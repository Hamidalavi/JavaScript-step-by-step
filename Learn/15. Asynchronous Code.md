# Asynchronous Code

In this course, you will learn about:

- What is **Async Code**
- Working with  Callbacks
- Promises
- `async` / `await`

## Synchronous Code Execution

**JavaScript** is single-threaded, it can only execute one task at a time, consider:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const output = document.querySelector("p");

function trackUserHandler() {}

button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);
```

**JavaScript** parses and executes our code from top to buttom. In above code, **JavaScript** selects that `<button>` and stores it in a constant. Then only once first line finished, the second line is executed and this task is performed.

When **JavaScript** reads the file at the beginning, the in the execution process, this `button.addEventListener...` line executes after these two lines (first and second) executed. Because we need the `button` to be available in order to add an event listener. So we rely on this order which is enforced by **JavaScript**.

Multi-thread is bad for **JavaScript**. If it would be multi-threaded, it could maybe execute all tasks at the same time and here this would actually be bad, because we could not rely on the `button` to be available when we need it. For example, if `button.addEventListener...` line is executed at the same time as `const button = document...` line, then the `button` might not have been selected yet and therefore adding an event listener to it would maybe fail.

## Asynchronous Code Execution

Consider this code:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const p = document.querySelector("p");

function trackUserHandler() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  result += i;
}

console.log(result);
```

We clicked on that `button`, then this click is registered and the browser pushes `trackUserHandler` function as a **to-do** onto our message queue, but the event loop sees that we still have work to do on the call stack and therefore, it waits to execute `trackUserHandler` function until the call stack is empty; that only happens once `for` loop executed, and once we logged `console.log(result)` to the console which is why we see the clicked output only after we see the `for` loop result, even if we click the button whilst this was still going on, because of how the browser handles this.

Let's see another example:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const p = document.querySelector("p");

function trackUserHandler() {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (posData) => console.log(posData),
    (error) => console.log(error)
  );
}

button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  result += i;
}

console.log(result);
/*
Block: GeolocationPositionError {code: 1, message: "User denied Geolocation"}
Allow: Position: {coords: Coordinates, timestamp: 1568621297168}
or
GeolocationPositionError {code: 2, message: "Network location provider at 'https://www.googleapis.com/' : No response received."}
*/
```

As we said before, it **pushes it into the message queue** where the **event loop eventually movies it** into the **JavaScript** call stack. If we put `console.log("Hamid")` after that function, we will see:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const p = document.querySelector("p");

function trackUserHandler() {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (posData) => console.log(posData),
    (error) => console.log(error)
  );
  console.log("Hamid");
}

button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  result += i;
}

console.log(result);
/*
"Hamid"
Block: GeolocationPositionError {code: 1, message: "User denied Geolocation"}
Allow: Position: {coords: Coordinates, timestamp: 1568621297168}
or
GeolocationPositionError {code: 2, message: "Network location provider at 'https://www.googleapis.com/' : No response received."}
*/
```

As you can see, we see that the `"hamid"` was printed first. Because **JavaScript** is non-blocking.

## Callback

Consider:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const p = document.querySelector("p");

function trackUserHandler() {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (posData) => setTimeout(() => console.log(posData), 4000),
    (error) => console.log(error)
  );
  setTimeout(() => console.log("Timer done"), 0);
  console.log("Getting positions...");
}

button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
Getting positions...
test.js:9 Timer done
test.js:7 GeolocationPositionError {code: 2, message: "Network location provider at 'https://www.googleapis.com/' : No response received."}
*/
```

`console.log("Getting positions...")` code always executes first, this executes right away after `setTimeout()` (i.e. `"Timer don"`) executes; and even though the timer immediately finishes, this function still only executes after `console.log("Getting positions...")` line is done.

In `setTimeout(() => console.log("Timer done"), 0);` line, `0` is the minimum time after which the callback function will be executed. **It's not the guaranteed time**; if it were guaranteed, it would need to run immediately. If we had the long running `for` loop instead of `console.log("Getting positions...")`, then this `setTimeout(() => console.log("Timer done"), 0)` timer would only execute once the long running `for` loop is done which might take three seconds.

**Note**: `0` is not a zero value, it's a minimum value in `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` methods. It's not the guaranteed time.

## Promises

Let's consider this snippet:

```js
// Callback
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(() =>
  setTimeout(() => doMoreAsyncStuff(() => console.log("Helllo")), 1000)
);
```

It's hard to understand, it's cumbersome to read this code. Thankfully **JavaScript** bring us the **Promises** to solve this issue. Let's consider this code:

```js
// Promise
someAsyncTask()
  .then(() => anotherTask())
  .then(() => yetAnotherTask())
  .then();
```

As you can see, we have better and easier way to doing our tasks. In this code, we add another `then()` block instead of nesting it into each other; and therefore we have only **one level of nesting here instead of having multiple levels**.

We can use promises with the `Promise` constructor. The `Promise` object skeleton is:

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { });
```

## Promise - Resovle

Let's work with the promises:

```js
const setTimer = (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

function trackUserHandler() {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (posData) => setTimer(2000).then((data) => console.log(data, posData)),
    (error) => console.log(error)
  );
  console.log("Getting positions...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
Getting positions...
Done! GeolocationPosition {coords: GeolocationCoordinates, timestamp: 1601954982558}
*/
```

Or we can pass the location into a new promise, for example:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => console.log(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

function trackUserHandler() {
  let positionData;
  getPosition()
    .then((posData) => {
      positionData = posData;
      return setTimer(2000);
    })
    .then((data) => console.log(data, positionData));
  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting positions...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);
```

As you can see, we have multiple steps in this (in `getPosition`) promise, where we wait for the first promise (i.e. `getPosition()`) to finish and then we return `setTimer()` which doesn't even have to be a promise by the way. If it would be other data like a string (i.e. `return 'setTimer(2000)'`), it would be wrapped into a promise automatically. Then we'll wait for this promise to resolve, then once this promise finished, we move on to the next `.then()` step and execute that with the data of that returned promise (i.e. `return setTimer(2000)`).

This is promise chaining and this is a powerful concept which lets you escape from **callback hell**. Because now we have **step after step** instead of **step inside step** would lead to a lot of nesting, if you have a lot of related operation.

## Promise - Reject

There is another state and that is the **failed state** basically, that we have an error. So the promise is now not resolved; it's not pending, but it has an error.

Errors are not handled with the normal `then()` functions. Instead, `then()` takes a second argument. The first argument here is the callback function that should be executed if the promise resolves, the second argument is the potential error function we might have.

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

function trackUserHandler() {
  let positionData;
  getPosition()
    .then((posData) => {
      positionData = posData;
      return setTimer(2000);
    }, (err) => console.log(err))
    .then(
      (data) => console.log(data, positionData)
    );
  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting positions...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
Getting positions...
test.js:59 Timer done!
test.js:54 GeolocationPositionError {code: 1, message: "User denied Geolocation"}
test.js:56 undefined undefined <--- this line for reject
*/
```

That's a second argument we're passing to the `then` method. Here, `(err) => console.log(err)` a second function we're passing to `then` method. **the first function (argument)(i.e. `(data) => console.log(data, positionData)`) is the success case when the promise resolves; the second function (argument)(i.e. `(err) => console.log(err)`) is the failure case**, when a promise does not resolve but instead rejects.

We have an alternative to that, we have another method we can add to our promise chain and that's the `catch()` method. The `catch()` method can be added on a promise and we can add it anywhere in this chain. For example:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

function trackUserHandler() {
  let positionData;
  getPosition()
    .then((posData) => {
      positionData = posData;
      return setTimer(2000);
    })
    .catch((err) => console.log(err))
    .then((data) => console.log(data, positionData));
  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting positions...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
Getting positions...
test.js:59 Timer done!
test.js:54 GeolocationPositionError {code: 1, message: "User denied Geolocation"}
test.js:56 undefined undefined <--- this line for reject
*/
```

`catch()` method actually does exactly the same as if we pass it as a second argument to one of our `then()` block. Let us give you an example:

```js
someAsyncTask()
  .then(() => anotherTask())
  .catch((err) => console.log(err))
  .then(() => yetAnotherTask())
  .then();

```

If this promise rejects for example, it's not just the case that this `then()` block wil be skipped, instead all `then()` blocks thereafter will be skipped until we reach a `catch()` block or a second argument to handle the error.

**Warning**: The `catch()` method does not cancel the entire promise chain. If you want to cancel the promise chain, you have to move it to the end of all your `then()` blocks; because only then you make sure that if one of them rejects, the other ones are skipped and you make it into `catch()`. For example:

```js
someAsyncTask()
  .then(() => anotherTask())
  .then(() => yetAnotherTask())
  .then()
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

If you add `catch()` method somewhere in the middle, then all prior ones are skipped if one of them rejects. But `then()` blocks after `catch()` will be executed. Let's do this with previous example:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

function trackUserHandler() {
  let positionData;
  getPosition()
    .then((posData) => {
      positionData = posData;
      return setTimer(2000);
    })
    .catch((err) => "on we go...")
    .then((data) => console.log(data, positionData));
  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting positions...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
Getting positions...
Timer done!
on we go... undefined
*/
```

We still get `undefined` because `positionData` is `undefined`. Because we skipped `then((posData)...` block as we explained; but `data` is what we returned in the `catch()` block and that's not a bug. That's of course very useful, because it allows us (you) to structure our chain such that certain parts of it can be skipped if necessary.

## Working More with `then()` and `catch()` Methods

You learned about the different promise states:

**PENDING** => Promise is doing work, neither `then()` nor `catch()` executes at this moment.

**RESOLVED** => Promise is resolved => `then()` executes.

**REJECTED**  => Promise was rejected => `catch()` executes.

When you have another `then()` block after a `catch()` or `then()` block, the promise re-enters `PENDING` mode (keep in mind: `then()` and `catch()` always return a new promise - either not resolving to anything or resolving to what you return inside of `then()`). Only if there are no more `then()` blocks left, it enters a new, final mode: `SETTLED`.

Once **SETTLED**, you can use a special block - `finally()` - to do final cleanup work. `finally()` is reached no matter if you resolved or rejected before.

Here's an example:

```js
somePromiseCreatingCode()
  .then((firstResult) => {
    return "done with first promise";
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // would handle any errors thrown before
    // implicitly returns a new promise - just like then()
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // the promise is settled now - finally() will NOT return a new promise!
    // you can do final cleanup work here
  });
```

**You don't have to add a `finally()` block (indeed we haven't in the lectures)**.

## `async` and `await` Keywords

We can use `async` and `await` in function and **only in functions**. We enable it by adding the `async` keyword in front of our `function` keyword, for example:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() { // <--- this line
  let positionData;
  getPosition()
    .then((posData) => {
      positionData = posData;
      return setTimer(2000);
    })
    .catch((err) => "on we go...")
    .then((data) => console.log(data, positionData));
}
```

For function expressions, we would use `async` keyword in front of our function name (right side of the `=` sign), for example:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => { // <--- this line
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  let positionData;
  getPosition()
    .then((posData) => {
      positionData = posData;
      return setTimer(2000);
    })
    .catch((err) => "on we go...")
    .then((data) => console.log(data, positionData));
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);
```

See the `setTimer()` function. When we use the `async` in front of this function, this function **automatically returns a promise** (you can test it in the **VS Code** editor and hover on that function and see the its tooltip). If we use the `async` keyword in front of any function, that entire function wraps all its content into one big promise.

We can use the `await` keyword in front of any promise. For example, `await getPosition().then(...)...`:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  let positionData;
  await getPosition() // <--- this line
    .then((posData) => {
      positionData = posData;
      return setTimer(2000);
    })
    .catch((err) => "on we go...")
    .then((data) => console.log(data, positionData));
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);
```

**Q**: What does `await` then do if we add it in front of a promise?

**Answer**: It waits or the promise to resolve or to fail and the next line thereafter will only execute once that is the case.

> It looks like we're changing the way **JavaScript** works, that suddenly we wait for async code to finish and that we block script execution untill that is the case. **But that's actually thankfully not what's happening**:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  const posData = await getPosition();
  const timerData = await setTimer(2000);
  console.log(timerData, posData);
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
After 2 seconds: Done! GeolocationPosition {coords: GeolocationCoordinates, timestamp: 1602047169645}
*/
```

Instead, `async` wraps everything inside of `trackUserHandler` into one big promise and then it actually goes ahead and whenever we `await` for some other promise (i.e. `getPosition()`) which wrapped in that big promise to resolve; it in the end just returns `await getPosition()` as part of that big promise it created for us and adds an invisible `then()` block. In the `then()` block, it will then get the result of this promise and store it in `posData` variable which is available in that big overall promise.

So in the end, it replicates this `then()` block (we show the code after this line) behind the scenes.

```js
.then((posData) => {
  positionData = posData;
  return setTimer(2000);
})
```

**Q**: Why we must use the `async` keyword only in front of functions?

**Answer**: Because we have a couple of `then()` methods chained after each other.

You think that now you're changing the way **JavaScript** works; **you are not**. You're having an invisible transformation here.

## `async` and `await` and Error Handling

In previous code, we lost error handling. We have no replacement for the `catch()` block at the moment. We can use `try..catch` here as you learned earlier:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  let posData;
  let timerData;
  try {
    posData = await getPosition();
    timerData = await setTimer(2000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  console.log(timerData, posData);
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
Allow: Done! GeolocationPosition {coords: GeolocationCoordinates, timestamp: 1602049215126}

Block: GeolocationPositionError {code: 1, message: "User denied Geolocation"}
undefined undefined
*/
```

This is how we can handle error correctly in an `async await` world. **Instead of `catch()`, with `try..catch`**.

## Different Between `async await` vs Raw Promises

Consider:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  let posData;
  let timerData;
  try {
    posData = await getPosition();
    timerData = await setTimer(2000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  console.log(timerData, posData);

  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting position...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

/*
Done! GeolocationPosition {coords: GeolocationCoordinates, timestamp: 1602050382861}
Getting position...
Timer done!
*/
```

> One -- different outputs

In `awaits`, this not pause code execution but behind the scenes, all these steps (in `posData = await getPosition()`) in the end get wrapped into their own `then()` blocks and therefore, `setTimer(1000).then(() => {...` has its own `then()` block as well and therefore this only executes after this (below code) code is finished:

```js
try {
    posData = await getPosition();
    timerData = await setTimer(2000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
```

You can see the output for what's happening here. So `async await` is not that great. If we have a function in which we need to execute or kick off multiple things simultaneously and don't want to execute everything after each other.

> Two -- only available on functions

`async await` is only available on functions. If we had some code outside of a function, like `await setTimer(1000);`, then we can't use `await` here. Because `await` can only be used in functions which are marked with `async` and `await setTimer(1000);` is not part of a function. It's part of this global anonymous function which we get automatically but that's not an `async` function. We could use `async` like this:

```js
(async function () {
  await setTimer(1000);
})();
```

This would work, but that's not beautiful. instead we can use `then()` method, for example:

```js
setTimer(1000).then(...)
```

## `Promise.race()`

`race()` method takes an array of promises (e.g. `getPosition()` and `setTimer(1000)`), for example:

```js
Promise.race([getPosition(), setTimer(1000)]);
```

The only special thing is that the data returns will be the result of the fastest promise. They will both be kicked off at the same time and the one which first finishes will then be handled by the subsequent `then` or `catch()` promise chain:

```js
Promise.race([getPosition(), setTimer(1000)]).then();
```

Let's see an example:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  let posData;
  let timerData;
  try {
    posData = await getPosition();
    timerData = await setTimer(2000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  console.log(timerData, posData);

  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting position...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

Promise.race([getPosition(), setTimer(1000)]).then((data) => console.log(data));

/*
Block after a second: Done!
Block immediately: Test.html:1 Uncaught (in promise) GeolocationPositionError {code: 1, message: "User denied Geolocation"}

Allow after a second: Done!
Allow immediately: GeolocationPosition {coords: GeolocationCoordinates, timestamp: 1602053283424}
*/
```

See the output (// Block after a second), because that on second timer executed faster than `getPosition()` and if we then do click `Block` here, nothing happens with that. Because `race()` method only cared about the fastest promise, so `setTimer(1000)` was the winning promise.

On the other hand, if we click `Block` super fast, we see now this promise failed and we don't see `"Done!"` because now the result of the second promise was discarded and that first one (i.e. `getPosition()`) finished instead (first element of array is winner).

## `Promise.all()`

The `all()` method syntax is like the `race()` method, for example:

```js
Promise.all([getPosition() setTimer(1000)]);
```

We'll then get a normal promise (i.e. `then()` method) as a result, but the data of that promise will be the combined data of our other promises:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  let posData;
  let timerData;
  try {
    posData = await getPosition();
    timerData = await setTimer(2000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  console.log(timerData, posData);

  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting position...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

Promise.all([getPosition(), setTimer(1000)]).then((data) => console.log(data));

/*
Allow:
(2) [GeolocationPosition, "Done!"]
  0: GeolocationPosition {coords: GeolocationCoordinates, timestamp:   1602054848610}
  1: "Done!"
  length: 2
  __proto__: Array(0)

Block: Uncaught (in promise) GeolocationPositionError {code: 1, message: "User denied Geolocation"}
*/
```

Look at the **Block** result, you see the `Uncaught (in promise)` error. If one of the promises fails (is rejected), then the other promise is not executed and we're not waiting for all to resolve or all to reject (this is cancelled and we just get the error).

## `Promise.allSettled()`

That's a very new, it looks like the `Promise.all()` but with more description:

```js
const getPosition = (options) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(success),
      (error) => reject(error),
      options
    );
  });
  return promise;
};

const setTimer = async (duration) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), duration);
  });
  return promise;
};

async function trackUserHandler() {
  let posData;
  let timerData;
  try {
    posData = await getPosition();
    timerData = await setTimer(2000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  console.log(timerData, posData);

  setTimer(1000).then(() => {
    console.log("Timer done!");
  });
  console.log("Getting position...");
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);

Promise.allSettled([getPosition(), setTimer(1000)]).then((data) => console.log(data));

/*
Block:
(2) [{…}, {…}]
  0: {status: "rejected", reason: GeolocationPositionError}
  1: {status: "fulfilled", value: "Done!"}
  length: 2
  __proto__: Array(0)

Allow:
(2) [{…}, {…}]
  0: {status: "fulfilled", value: GeolocationPosition}
  1: {status: "fulfilled", value: "Done!"}
  length: 2
  __proto__: Array(0)
*/
```

The interesting thing here is that now since we got this detailed description, we got more flexibility. **It does not cancel the execution of other promises if one of them is rejected**. It still completes or looks at all of them and then gives us a detailed summary of which promise failed and which promise succeeded.
