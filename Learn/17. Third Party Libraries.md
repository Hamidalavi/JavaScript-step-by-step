# 17. Third Party Libraries

In this course, you will learn about: Third Party Libraries

## Difference - lodash

The first library is the **lodash**. With this library, we can do alot of things. For example, comparing two values. Consider:

**Note**: Before we start this course, we loaded the **lodash** script with cdn: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.20/lodash.min.js"></script>`

```js
const customers = ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"];
const activeCustomers = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
const inactiveCustomers = _.difference(customers, activeCustomers);

console.log(inactiveCustomers); // ["Ali"]
```

We **can't** use this code like:

```js
const customers = ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"];
const activeCustomers = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
const inactiveCustomers = customers - activeCustomers;

console.log(inactiveCustomers); // NaN
```

because, they are object and they can't be subtract.

## Libraries

We have thousands of libraries in **JavaScript**, one of them is **lodash** library. Another libraries are for exmaple, **jQuery** or **axios.js** and etc. **axios.js** library is awesome for HTTP request. We said we have a third-party library that for HTTP request.

> We also have third-party libraries to use the easiest way of `XMLHttpRequest` object or `fetch()` API. We explain these libraries in later courses.

You would very happy when you use this library (i.e. axios). Because this third-party library is awsome and easy to use, let's look at this library:

- First of all, we need to add this library to our project (in HTML content) for example, we added it with cdn:

  ```js
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"   defer></script>
  ```

- Then, we can easily use this library. Different with `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch()` and `axios.js` is:

  1. We can remove the `sendHttpRequest("GET", "url");` function an just use `axios.get("url")` (16 lines to 1 line). This is great for HTTP request.

  2. We also have `axios.post("url", post);` and `axios.delete("url")` for POST and DELETE methods.

  3. These methods automatically return a promise.

  4. We don't need to convert some streamed data into snapshot.

  5. We don't need to parse it from JSON to **JavaScript** data. Instead, we get that automatically converted snapshot as part of our response object.

  6. We can just say `listOfPosts = response.data` from `axios.get("url")` instead of `listOfPosts = responseData` from `sendHttpRequest("GET","url")`.

  7. **axios** brings us a nice error message and status code. It does not just throw an error. If we have a technical problem like a network connectivity issue, it also throws an error (before it, when we get an error, we make it into the `catch()` block. Here without any extra work).

  8. We don't have to add any headers with axios (for the `fetch()` API and `XMLHttpRequest`, we manually had to add the `"application/json"` content type header).

  9. **axios** will detect the `FormData` object like `XMLHttpRequest` object and `fetch()` API.

Let's look at following example:

```js
const listElement = document.querySelector(".posts");
const postTemplate = document.getElementById("single-post");
const fetchButton = document.querySelector("#available-posts button");
const form = document.querySelector("#new-post form");
const postList = document.querySelector("ul");

async function fetchPosts() {
  try {
    const responseData = await axios.get(
      "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
    );

    const listOfPosts = responseData.data;
    for (const post of listOfPosts) {
      const postEl = document.importNode(postTemplate.content, true);
      postEl.querySelector("h2").textContent = post.title.toUpperCase();
      postEl.querySelector("p").textContent = post.body;
      postEl.querySelector("li").id = post.id;
      listElement.append(postEl);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    alert(error.message);
  }
}

function createPost(userId = Math.random()) {
  const fd = new FormData(form);
  fd.append("userId", userId);

  axios.post("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", fd);
}

fetchButton.addEventListener("click", fetchPosts);
form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const enteredTitle = event.currentTarget.querySelector("#title").value;
  const enteredContent = event.currentTarget.querySelector("#content").value;
  createPost();
});

postList.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === "BUTTON") {
    const postId = event.target.closest("li").id;
    axios.delete(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${postId}`);
  }
});
```
