# JavaScript Modules Tooling (Webpack, Babel and etc.)

In this course, you will learn about:

- Writing Modular Code
- `export` & `import` Keywords
- Add Multiple Things
- `*` Wildcard Character & `as` Keyword
- Working with Default Exports

## Splitting Code in a Sub-optimal Way

We can split code in a sub-optimal way. For example, we can do this:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Modern Project Board</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/app.css" />
  <script src="assets/scripts/Utility/DOMHelper.js" defer></script>
  <script src="assets/scripts/App/Component.js" defer></script>
  <script src="assets/scripts/App/Tooltip.js" defer></script>
  <script src="assets/scripts/App/ProjectItem.js" defer></script>
  <script src="assets/scripts/App/ProjectList.js" defer></script>
  <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>
</head>
```

We splitted our big code into small piece files. This way is working well; but these files need dependency. For example, if we use `app.js` file at the first line, the project will break; because `app.js` needs all of these files to work correctly.

## `export` and `import` Keywords

Another way of doing more conveniently is that we can use `export` and `import` keywords in the **JavaScript** file for locking the code, for example:

```js
export class Component {
  constructor(hostElementId, insertBefore = false) {
    if (hostElementId) {
      this.hostElement = document.getElementById(hostElementId);
    } else {
      this.hostElement = document.body;
    }
    this.insertBefore = insertBefore;
  }

  detach = () => {
    if (this.element) {
      this.element.remove();
    }
  };

  attach() {
    this.hostElement.insertAdjacentElement(
      this.insertBefore ? "afterbegin" : "beforeend",
      this.element
    );
  }
}
```

For use modular code, you need:

1. You need to install **NodeJS** app in your computer. Then use `npm -g serve` command for install a custom web server. You can use it with `serve` command in **NodeJS**. Or you can use google chrome web server plugin to use it.
2. For the `app.js` file, you need to set the `type` attribute and `module` for its value. For example:

   ```html
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /   >
     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
     <title>Modern Project Board</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/app.css" />
     <script src="assets/scripts/Utility/DOMHelper.js" defer></script>
     <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/App/Component.js" defer></script> -->
     <script src="assets/scripts/App/Tooltip.js" defer></script>
     <script src="assets/scripts/App/ProjectItem.js" defer></script>
     <script src="assets/scripts/App/ProjectList.js" defer></script>
     <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer type="module"></script>
   </head>
   ```

**Note**: We can export all things such as `function`, `class`, `var`, `let`, `const` and so on.

Now we want to import any exported code. We can import that code to another files with `import` keyword, for example:

```js
import { Component } from "./Component.js";
```

For the `Tooltip.js` file, we also need to set the `type` attribute and `module` for its value. Because we want to write a modular code. For example:

```js
<script src="assets/scripts/App/Tooltip.js" defer type="module"></script>
```

Or we can remove all `<script>` sources and just work with `app.js` file, for example:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Modern Project Board</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/app.css" />
  <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/Utility/DOMHelper.js" defer></script> -->
  <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/App/Component.js" defer></script> -->
  <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/App/Tooltip.js" defer type="module"></script> -->
  <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/App/ProjectItem.js" defer></script> -->
  <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/App/ProjectList.js" defer></script> -->
  <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer type="module"></script>
</head>
```

**Note**: Don't forget to use `type="module"` (in this example).

**Warning**: We can't explain `import` and `export` in this book. You can try it by your own. Or we can bring you a short video about these keywords.

## Add Multiple Things

We can import multiple exports to any **JavaScript** file by adding a `,` comma. For example:

```js
import { func, vari, cons, clas } from "./file.js";
```

In this code, we added multiple things such as fucntion, variable, constant and class and we added them by adding a `,` comma.

## `*` Wildcard and `as` keyword

Sometimes we want to bundle all these things which are getting exported by this file (i.e. `./file.js`) in one object which we then have available in the `wantImport.js` file on which we can access these different exported features. That is possible with a special `*` syntax (character). Consider:

```js
import * from "./file.js";
```

It's like good, but in doesn't work; because we have no name for that.

> **JavaScript**: How can I find these exported features. Please give me a name for this import method.

Then we can choose a name with `as` keyword and then any name of our choice, for example:

```js
import * as Component from "./file.js";

Component.func();
Component.ClassTest(test);
```

We can also make an alias with normal import method with a `as` keyword, for example:

```js
import { ProjectList as PrjList } from "./file.js";

PrjList.render();
```

This name (i.e. `PrjList`) does not change the original class name. Instead, it makes it readable for us.

## Working with Default Exports

We can import default values in **JavaScript**. We can export values by default with `default` keyword. For example:

```js
export default class {
  constructor() {}
}
```

**Note**: If you use `default` keyword, the name of that variable, class, function or contant will be ignored.

We can use import that default export with simple way:

```js
import Prj from "./file.js"; // this is default
```

If we would want to import that named `doSomething` export, we would do that by simply combining this with a `,` comma and with a `{}` curly brace list of named imports. For example:

```js
import Prj, { ProjectList } from "./file.js";
```

In this code, we combined the **named** and **default** imports.

## Dynamic `import`

As an alternative of static `import`, we have the dynamic `import` syntax. If we know something always needs to run, we don't need to make them to dynamic import. We can make them dynamically with `import()` built-in function; this function returns a promise, for example:

```js
import("path").then((module) => {});
```

```js
import("./test.js").then((module) => {new module.Tooltip(); ...});
```

In this example, if we call Tooltip class, two files will be loaded and this class or file does not load initially.

**Important**: Code in modules does execute. But it only executes once when a module is imported and used for the first time.

The dynamic import which can help us split our code and download things only when we need them instead of download all files or download all parts of the file.
