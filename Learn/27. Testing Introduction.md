# Introduction to Testing

In this course, you will learn about:

- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Test Both Synchronous & Asynchronous Code

## What is Testing

**Q**: Why would we want to test?

**Answer**:

1. We want to get an error and see the error if we break our code, we want to see that immediately without us testing everything manually.
2. We'll also save time if we don't have to set everything manulally over and over again.
3. We're also forced to think about possible issues ore bugs when writing our tests.
4. We can also integrate it into our build wokflow, **i.e** we have a workflow that automatically is triggered where this code is then tested in the cloud on some server and if the test succeeds, it's maybe deployed automatically.
5. We can also break up complex dependencies, we have to make sure we write code that can be split up. That is modular, because this will make testing easier and ultimately it will make working with our code easier.
6. It improves our code.

## Different Kinds of Tests

- We have some tests that test a fully isolated piece of code (e.g. testing one function). Let's say a function that takes some input and returns some output. We can test such a function with a test, because it has a clearly defined structure and we can say for input `x` and `y`, we expect to get output `z`; and that would be a so-called **Unit Test**. Because we test a single, isolated unit of our application.

- We also have some tests that test units with some dependencies. So we have no isolated piece of code anymore, but we might have a function that calls another function; and therefore the function we're testing depends on the result of another function and that is called an **Integration Tests**. Because there, we're testing more than just a single unit.

- We also have the full flow which we can test or the user interface; so the full application or a part of the full application; and this is so-called **End-to-End** or also user interface test (e.g. validating the DOM after a click).

## Working with Unit Test

First of all, we need to install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` packages from `npm`. Let's consider these files:

```html

</head>

<body>
    <section class="control-panel">
        <div class="input-container">
            <label for="name">Name</label>
            <input type="text" id="name">
        </div>
        <div class="input-container">
            <label for="age">Age</label>
            <input type="number" id="age">
        </div>
        <button id="btnAddUser" class="button">Add User</button>
    </section>
    <hr>
    <section class="user-output">
        <ul class="user-list"></ul>
    </section>
    <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
// app.js file
const { generateText, createElement, validateInput } = require("./util");

const initApp = () => {
  const newUserButton = document.getElementById("btnAddUser");
  newUserButton.addEventListener("click", addUser);
};

const addUser = () => {
  const newUserNameInput = document.getElementById("name");
  const newUserAgeInput = document.getElementById("age");

  if (
    !validateInput(newUserNameInput.value, true, false) ||
    !validateInput(newUserAgeInput.value, false, true)
  ) {
    return;
  }

  const userList = document.querySelector(".user-list");
  const outputText = generateText(
    newUserNameInput.value,
    newUserAgeInput.value
  );
  const element = createElement("li", outputText, "user-item");
  userList.append(element);
};

initApp();
```

```js
// util.js file
exports.generateText = (name, age) => {
  return `${name} (${age} years old)`;
};

exports.createElement = (type, text, className) => {
  const newElement = document.createElement(type);
  newElement.classList.add(className);
  newElement.textContent = text;
  return newElement;
};

exports.validateInput = (text, notEmpty, isNumber) => {
  if (!text) {
    return false;
  }
  if (notEmpty && text.trim().length === 0) {
    return false;
  }
  if (isNumber && +text === NaN) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
};
```

  "devDependencies": {

  }
}
```

We want to test our application with `jest.js` library, for do that, we need to install it with `npm install --save-dev jest` command. You can install all of them easily with `npm install` command. Then we have:

```json
{
  "name": "js-testing-introduction",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An introduction to JS testing",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack app.js --mode development --watch",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [

    "jest",

  ],
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^26.6.3",
    "webpack": "^4.20.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.1.2"
  }
}
```

We can write our first test and we'll write our test for functions defined in `util.js`. So the first function (i.e. `generateText`) makes up for a great first **unit test**. It has no other dependencies, because it doesn't call any other functions, it doesn't reach out to the web or anything like that; it simply takes input, two arguments and returns an output.

Now to write a test for this function, we create a separate file into which we'll store our tests. We can create a test files with `.spec.js` or `.test.js` extension. We recommend you to use `.test.js` (i.e. `util.test.js`).

`jest` will automatically detect files with `.test.js` or `.spec.js` in them, it will run them automatically once we run `jest`. Let's import that function into our `util.test.js` script file:

```js
const { generateText } = require("./util");
```

**Note**: `import { generateText } from "./util";` will not work. Not only because we not using **ES6** exports here, that is also a problem; but even if we would use them, this is not a syntax natively supported by `jest`.

For the first start, we write `test()` function. This is a function which is now globally available in `jest`. This function takes two parameters, first one is for the test name or description. The second function argument is then an anonymous function which we pass in, which is the function `jest` will execute to really run our tests.

```js
const { generateText } = require("./util");

test("should output name and age", () => {
  const text = generateText("Hamid", 23);
});
```

We can formulate that function with `expect()` function which is also provided by `jest`. For example the ouput must be `"Hamid Alavi (23)"`, then we need to use `toBe()` function, for example:

```js
const { generateText } = require("./util");

test("should output name and age", () => {
  const text = generateText("Hamid", 23);
  expect(text).toBe("Hamid Alavi (23 years old)");
});
```

For testing our code, we need to change the `"test"` script to `"jest"` in `package.json` file (i.e. `"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"` to `"jest"`). This will automatically search for files with `.test.js` or `.spec.s` in the name and execute them. Now we can easily test our script with `npm test` command.

```nothing
$ npm test

> js-testing-introduction@1.0.0 test C:\Users\ultih\OneDrive\Documents\14. Testing
> jest

 FAIL  ./util.test.js
  × should output name and age (16 ms)

  ● should output name and age

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: "Hamid Alavi (23"
    Received: "Hamid (23 years old)"

      3 | test("should output name and age", () => {
      4 |   const text = generateText("Hamid", 23);
    > 5 |   expect(text).toBe("Hamid Alavi (23");
        |                ^
      6 | });
      7 |

      at Object.<anonymous> (util.test.js:5:16)

```

This test failed, because we put `"Hamid"` instead of `"Hamid Alavi"`. If we change it to `"Hamid Alavi"`, then:

```nothing
$ npm test

> js-testing-introduction@1.0.0 test C:\Users\ultih\OneDrive\Documents\14. Testing
> jest

 PASS  ./util.test.js

```

We can see the real-time test with `"test": "jest --watchAll"` in `package.json` file.

**Note**: You can check more than one thing in a **Unit Test** (by adding more `test()` and `expect()` functions).

## Working with E2E Test

First of all we need to install `puppeteer` package from node package manager:

```js
npm install --save-dev puppeteer
```

**Node**: If you get an error, use vpn for the installation.

This package install chromium (about 150MB). Then we can test our application visually.

Next step is, we import it in our test file:

```js
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");
```

Then we use it visually:

```js
test("You should click", async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: false,
    slowMo: 18,
    args: ["window-size=1920,1080"]
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(
    "file:///C:/Users/ultih/OneDrive/Documents/14.%20Testing/index.html"
  );
});
```

If we use `npm test`, new window will open (chromium browser) that it say **Chrome is being controlled by automated test software** and that means we use it successfully. We can test our application in the browser instead of the CLI. Now the CLI said:

```nothing
$ npm test

> js-testing-introduction@1.0.0 test C:\Users\ultih\OneDrive\Documents\14. Testing
> jest

 PASS  ./util.test.js
  √ should output name and age (5 ms)
  √ You should click (2087 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        7.535 s
Ran all test suites.
Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
```

`Tests:       2 passed, 2 total` means that we have two tests. First one is for our first test, second one is for our E2E test.

We can improve the test speed by comment out some code:

```js
const { generateText } = require("./util");
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

test("should output name and age", () => {
  const text = generateText("Hamid Alavi", 23);
  expect(text).toBe("Hamid Alavi (23 years old)");
});

test("You should click", async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: true,
    // slowMo: 18,
    // args: ["window-size=1920,1080"]
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(
    "file:///C:/Users/ultih/OneDrive/Documents/14.%20Testing/index.html"
  );
  await page.click("input#name");
  await page.type("input#name", "Hamid Alavi");
  await page.click("input#age");
  await page.type("input#age", "23");
  await page.click("#btnAddUser");
  const text = await page.$eval(".user-item", (el) => el.textContent);
  expect(text).toBe("Hamid Alavi (23 years old)");
});
```

Now, we are use it as non-browser (i.e. CLI) mode and the output is:

```nothing
$ npm test

> js-testing-introduction@1.0.0 test C:\Users\ultih\OneDrive\Documents\14. Testing
> jest

 PASS  ./util.test.js
  √ should output name and age (4 ms)
  √ You should click (1048 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        6.526 s
Ran all test suites.
Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
```

As you can see, we had two test, **should output name and age** and **You should click** and both are passed in test mode.

Now we got a full E2E test or a UI test (if we use args).

## Dealing with Async Code

First of all we need these packages (copy and paste and `npm install`):

```json
// package.json file
{
  "name": "js-testing-introduction",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An introduction to JS testing",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack app.js --mode development --watch",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "js",
    "javascript",
    "testing",
    "jest",
    "unit",
    "tests",
    "integration",
    "tests",
    "e2e",
    "tests"
  ],
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^26.6.3",
    "webpack": "^4.20.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.1.2"
  }
}
```

Then copy these code:

```html
<!-- HTML Content -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <title>JS Testing</title>
</head>

<body>
    <button>Get Post Title!</button>
    <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
// app.js file
const { fetchData } = require("./http");

const button = document.querySelector("button");

const loadTitle = () => {
  return fetchData().then((extractedData) => {
    const title = extractedData.title;
    const transformedTitle = title.toUpperCase();
    return transformedTitle;
  });
};

const printTitle = () => {
  loadTitle().then((title) => {
    console.log(title);
  });
};

button.addEventListener("click", printTitle);

exports.printTitle = printTitle;
```

```js
// http.js file
const axios = require('axios');

const fetchData = () => {
  return axios
    .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
    .then(response => {
      return response.data;
    });
};

exports.fetchData = fetchData;
```

After all, use `npm start` command to create a `main.js` file. These are in first steps.

If you test these files, you'll get an error of `addEventListener()`. The reason for that actually is that `app.js` file contains some code that will always run when this file (test file) gets executed and it does get executed when you import from that file and; it tries to access the DOM here (in `app.js`) which just doesn't work in this environment here. The real DOM is not loaded here.

So an easy way around that is to take those functions (`printTitle()` and `loadTitle()`) and export them into a separate file (e.g. `util.js`):

```js
// util.js file
const loadTitle = () => {
  return fetchData().then((extractedData) => {
    const title = extractedData.title;
    const transformedTitle = title.toUpperCase();
    return transformedTitle;
  });
};

const printTitle = () => {
  loadTitle().then((title) => {
    console.log(title);
  });
};

exports.printTitle = printTitle;
```

```js
// util.test.js file
const { printTitle } = require("./util");
test("should be a uppercase", () => {
  expect(printTitle().toBe("DELECTUS AUT AUTEM"));
});
```

```js
// app.js file
const { printTitle } = require("./util");

const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", printTitle);

exports.printTitle = printTitle;
```

If we test this again, we will get an error, because `TypeError: Cannot read property 'toBe' of undefined`. And now this already shows us a problem we have with **asynchronous** code testing. The reason for that is that, that has nothing to do with testing, that's normal **JavaScript** behavior. If we use `return title` instead of `console.log(title)`, we still get an error. `return` statement inside of callbacks or inside of promise `then()` calls are not executed or are executed but **JavaScript** does not wait for them, it does not return this value as a return value for this overall function. Instead this is the return value of that inner function here (`.then(title => title))` and we're not testing this inner function (we are tesing that overall function).

Now we can export the `loadTitle` into our `util.test.js` file and work with this:

```js
// util.test.js
const { loadTitle } = require("./util");
test("should be a uppercase", () => {
  loadTitle().then((title) => {
    expect(title).toBe("DELECTUS AUT AUTEM");
  });
});
```

The output is:

```nothing
$ npm test

> js-testing-introduction@1.0.0 test C:\Users\ultih\OneDrive\Documents\14.2. Testing (async)
> jest

 PASS  ./util.test.js
  √ should be a uppercase (39 ms)
