# Http Requests - Transfer Data Between Client & Server (Network Requests)

In this course, you will learn about:

- `XMLHttpRequest` & `fetch()` API
- JSON Data & FormData
- GETing Data & POSTing Data

## Behind the Scenes Requests

Let's describe it with an image (from academind):

## How Websites Work

Let's start with the most obvious way of using the internet: You visit a website like **persiansight.com**.

The moment you enter this address in your browser and you hit **enter**, a lot of different things happen (from academind):

1. The URL gets resolved
2. A Request is sent to the server of the website
3. A response of the server is parsed
4. The page is rendered and displayed

|`<script>` (Client-side)|Server-side|
|:-:|:-:|
|Frontend, detached from backend|May run on different server (i.e. different domain)
|Responsible for fetching & sending data|Responsible for storing & retrieving data (with database)|

The communication between the client-side and the server happens with the help of **HTTP Request / Response**. These **HTTP Request / Response** have to be configured and set up in a certain way.

When we're sending a request to the server, it needs to know the address (i.e. it needs to know the URL) made up of the domain and the path. The **path** is the part after the domain, for example:

- `URL`: persiansight.com/posts
- `Domain`: persiansight.com
- `Path`: /posts

Each Http Request has a Http method that is assigned to it. These are:

- `GET` => To get data: The `GET` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data.

- `POST` => To create data: The `POST` method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

- `PATCH` => To update data: The `PATCH` method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

- `PUT` => To update data: The `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

- `DELETE` => To delete data: The `DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.

> Status code: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status>

> HTTP header: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers>

If we use a combination that is not supported by the server-side, we'll get a Http error as a response.
