# JavaScript Tooling (Webpack, Babel and etc.)

In this course, you will learn about: Tooling

## Project Limitations & Why We Need Tools

If we use less whitespaces and shorter function name like A B C D, the size of file will be decreased and the page will load faster. **But** it's very hard to understand for us (humans).

Project Limitations:

- Micromanagement of Imports **or** Lots of Unnecessary Http Requests
- Unoptimized Code (not as small as possible)
- Potentially sub-optimal Browser Support
- Need to Reload Page Manually (after changes to code)
- Code Quality Is Not Checked

How to solve those issues:

|Name|Purpose|What is does|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**webpack-dev-server** or **serve**|A Development Server|Serve under  (more) realistic circumstances, auto-reload|
|Webpack|Bundling Tool|Combine multiple files into bundled code (less files)|
|Webpack Optimizer Plugins|Code Optimization Tool|Optimize code (shorten function names, remove whitespace, ...)|
|Babel|Code Compilation Tool|Write modern code, get **older** code as output|
|ESLint|Code Quality Checker|Check code quality, check for conventions & patterns|

First of all, we need to create a node package for our project. We must install nodeJS (app) and `npm` packages. Then inside it, we must write the `npm init` into it:

```json
{
  "name": "project-board",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## ESLint

We can install ESLint with `npm install --save-dev eslint` command. If we do that, our `package.json` will update (add ESLint with this version). We also have `node_modules` folder that holds all **JavaScript** code, but **important**: You should never change code in `node_modules` folder.

If we suddenly delete our `node_modules` folder, we can restore it with `npm install` command. When we run `npm install`, npm will go into our `package.json` file and look at our dependencies and development dependencies and install all the dependencies it finds there.

We can create a config for ESLint with `ctrl+p` or `cmd+p` in MACOS. We can also use `f1` key in VsCode text editor. For creating a configuration file, we need to type `eslint` and choose the `ESLint: Create ESLint configuration` option.

- FirstQ: We can choose how strict is ESLint (last option recommended).
- SecondQ: We can choose the type of modules (**`import`/`export`** recommended).
- ThirdQ: We can choose which framework does our project use (**None of these** recommended).
- FourthQ: We don't need to use TypeScript (press `n` for no).
- FifthQ: Where are code run? (**browser** recommended).
- SixthQ: We need to inspect or **JavaScript** files.
- SeventhQ: We must choose a path (e.g. `assets/scripts/app.js`).
- EighthQ: We need to config our file in JSON format.

After answering these questions, the file will be created and should be `.eslintrc.json` as name.

**Note1**: We can change the Lint rules for our scripts. For example:

- Press enter after a variable declaration (`newline-after-var` = `"always"` recommended).
- Use semi (semicolon) after each line (end of line).
- Use single quotes instead of double quotes.
- Complaining about trailing spaces.
- Error for having a `console.log()` command between our code (`no-console` = `"off"` recommended).
- Complaining about some magic numbers like `setInterval(() => console.log("hamid"), 2000);` (it would better to store them into a constant and use that here instead of `2000`).
- Press enter after a function declaration (`function-call-argument-newline` = `"off"` recommended).

**Note2**: We can fix all problems with `ESLint: Fix all auto-fixable Problems`.

**Note3**: Or we can remove all rules from rules part in `.eslintrc.json` file.

**Note4**: You can use `ctrl+space` between the double quote and select the options and its value (i.e. off, warn, always and so on).

You can set up your own rules from the ground up (basically what we started doing in the lectures) but you can also use presets and pre-configured rulesets.

To fully understand all options you can configure in .eslintrc.json, this part of the official docs should be helpful: <https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring>

## Bundling

Webpack is a bundling tool; it's also more than that, it helps us orchestrate our entire build workflow.

First of all, we need to install the webpack and webpack-cli:

`>>> sudo npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli` (remove the `sudo` command in other OS except for GNU/Linux)

If we do that, we will see:

```json
{
  "name": "project-board",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.11.0",
    "webpack": "^5.1.3",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

After that, we need to make a `webpack.config.js` file in our project and config with:

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts")
  }
};
```

In this code, `require()` is Node require. `module.exports` object gets an entry and then generates a path for output.

Then, in `package.json` file, in `"scripts"` part, we need to add a custom script, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "project-board",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.11.0",
    "webpack": "^5.1.3",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

We added the `"build"` to `scripts` section. Webpack will automatically search for such a `webpack.config.js` file and take this configuration (code inside of the file) into account.

**Warning**: Make sure you delete a `.js` extension from all imports (also in dynamic imports).

Some notes that you must do for bundling your files:

- Remove all `.js` extensions from static and dynamic imports.
- Don't use extra and trivial code.
- If you get an error, move functions and fields into the constructor function and use `this` keyword. For example use:

  ```js
  import { DOMHelper } from "../Utility/DOMHelper";

  export class ProjectItem {
    constructor(id, updateProjectListsFuntion, type) {
      this.id = id;
      this.hasActiveTooltip = false;
      this.updateProjectListsHandler = updateProjectListsFuntion;
      this.connectMoreInfoButton();
      this.connectSwitchButton(type);
      this.connectDrag();
    }
  }
  ```

  instead of:

  ```js
  import { DOMHelper } from "../Utility/DOMHelper";

  hasActiveTooltip = false;

  export class ProjectItem {
    constructor(id, updateProjectListsFuntion, type) {
      this.id = id;
      this.updateProjectListsHandler = updateProjectListsFuntion;
      this.connectMoreInfoButton();
      this.connectSwitchButton(type);
      this.connectDrag();
    }
  }
  ```

- In the example project, we only have **one main entry point**: `app.js`. In bigger projects - with multiple HTML pages - **you might have multiple scripts** for the different pages (HTML files) you might be building. Hence you **might need more than one entry point** because you want to build more than one bundle (i.e. not every HTML page uses the same script).

  So you need to write `entry: { x,y,z }` instead of `entry: ./src/app.js` as `module.exports` property.

  Now Webpack will **look up all these entry points** and create one bundle per entry point - you can then link to these bundles in your respective HTML files.

  You can learn more about multiple entry points with these two resources:

  - Code Splitting (i.e. generating more than one bundle): <https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/>

  - Entry Point Configuration: <https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry>

  And in general, check out the official Webpack docs to dive into it in detail: <https://webpack.js.org/guides/>

- Don't use `entries` for multiple entries. As we mentioned, use `entry: { x,y,z }`.

If you follow these webpack rules, your files will ready for create.

## Development Mode

We can use `development mode`:

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts")
  }
};
```

Then we use `npm run build` again. After that, new file will be added to our project that not really optimized (e.g. `src_App_Tooltip_js.app.js`).

We can also use `publicPath` key for `path` object to use generated file (e.g. `0.app.js` or `331.app.js`):

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts"),
    publicPath: "./assets/scripts"
  }
};
```

With this method, we won't get an error in future.

## Live Refresh

We can use `webpack-dev-server` package and script to enable the live reloading (WDS). We can do it exactly like `webpack` and `webpack-cli`:

- We must install the `webpack-dev-server` tool (package).
- Then, in `package.json` file, in `"scripts"` part, we need to add a custom script (e.g. `build:dev`).
- Finally we run it with `npm run build:dev` command (or we can use `sudo` in GNU/Linux).

Using these methods, our page will be recompiled when any changes occur.

**Note**: This method is deprecated.

## Debugging

For code debugging, we need to add the `devtool` property in `module.exports` object:

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts"),
    publicPath: "./assets/scripts",
  },
  devtool: "eval-cheap-module-source-map",
};
```

You can use some devtool from this page: <https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/>

We need to run `npm run build:dev` command again and go to the our `./src` folder (**Sources** tab in the browser developer tools). It's greate way for debugging our code.

## Production Mode

We can switch to the production mode with `production` value.

**Note**: Make sure that you create a new file (e.g. `webpack.config.prod.js`).

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "production",
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts"),
    publicPath: "./assets/scripts",
  },
  devtool: "eval-cheap-module-source-map",
};
```

Then we need to add a new custom script in our `package.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "project-board",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack",
    "build:dev": "webpack-dev-server",
    "build:prod": "webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.11.0",
    "webpack": "^5.1.3",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

We need to config our script, because webpack automatically searches for the `webpack.config.js` file. So we need to config it with `--config` value and then we must give a file name, for example:

```json
{
"scripts": {
    "build:prod": "webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js"
  }
}
```

Finally, we run it with `npm run build:prod` and then, new file will be added in our project (e.g. `app.js.map` or `331.app.js.map`).

**Note**: Make sure that you use the correct devtool (i.e. supports the production); for more information: <https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/>

## Final Optimization

**Method 1**: We can remove the older and unused files with `clean-webpack-plugin` package. We can install it with `npm install --save-dev clean-webpack-plugin` command.

After that, we must create a new class and use this class (in both `webpack.config.js` and `webpack.config.prod.js` files):

```js
const path = require("path");
const CleanPlugin = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts"),
    publicPath: "./assets/scripts",
  },
  devool: "eval-cheap-module-source-map",
  plugins: [new CleanPlugin.CleanWebpackPlugin()],
};
```

**Method 2**: We can randomize the files name with `[contenthash].js`. If we do this, the browser doesn't cache some css and styles (because there is no more the same file name found).

```js
const path = require("path");
const CleanPlugin = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "production",
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "[contenthash].js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts"),
    publicPath: "./assets/scripts",
  },
  devtool: "cheap-source-map",
  plugins: [new CleanPlugin.CleanWebpackPlugin()],
};

// output
5da9a9115e86d8de54f1.js
5da9a9115e86d8de54f1.js.map
d6920574f62410e9feac.js
d6920574f62410e9feac.js.map
```

This is now an output which will change every time we change the underlying files and we rebuild. Therefore since the file name now changes, browsers will redownload these files.

**Note**: If you think about `development` and `production` mode, we get that the `production` mode is good for randomize name of files for user and browser.

We can also use `lodash` library with `npm`. We install it with `npm i --save lodash` or `npm install --save lodash` command. So as you learned before, you can import this library with `import`: `import * as _ from "lodash"`.

Or `import * as _ from "lodash/array"` for only add array functionalities.

**Note**: `difference` is an array functionality, for example:

```js
import * as _ form "lodash";

_.difference([0, 1], [1, 2])
```
