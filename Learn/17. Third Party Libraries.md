# 17. Third Party Libraries

In this course, you will learn about: Third Party Libraries

## Difference - lodash

The first library is the **lodash**. With this library, we can do alot of things. For example, comparing two values. Consider:

**Note**: Before we start this course, we loaded the **lodash** script with cdn: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.20/lodash.min.js"></script>`

```js
const customers = ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"];
const activeCustomers = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
const inactiveCustomers = _.difference(customers, activeCustomers);

console.log(inactiveCustomers); // ["Ali"]
```

We **can't** use this code like:

```js
const customers = ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"];
const activeCustomers = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
const inactiveCustomers = customers - activeCustomers;

console.log(inactiveCustomers); // NaN
```

because, they are object and they can't be subtract.

## Libraries

We have thousand of libraries in **JavaScript**, one of them is **lodash**. Another libraries are for exmaple, **jQuery** or **axios.js** and etc.
