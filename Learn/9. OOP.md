# Classes & Object-oriented Programming

In this course, you learn about:

- What is **Object-oriented Programming** (OOP)?
- Classes & Instances
- Properties, Fields & Methods
- Inheritance

## Classes and Instances

The class skeleton is:

```js
class Example {
    ...
}
```

Let's take a look with different of `object` and `class`:

```js
const example1 = {
  title: "DEAFAULT",
  description: "NO DESCRIPTION",
};

class Example2 {
  title = "DEAFAULT";
  description = "NO DESCRIPTION";
}
```

- In `class` we must use `=` assignment instead of `:` colon.
- In `class` we must put `;` semicolon instead of `,` comma in the end of line after such a field.
- The convention is to **start with an uppercase character** (ex: `Example2`).
- In `class` we call `field` instead of `property`.
