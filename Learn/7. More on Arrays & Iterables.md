# Arrays & Iterables - Lists of Data

In this course, you learn about:

- Different Ways of Creating Arrays
- Working with Arrays
- Important Array Methods
- Other Iterables: Maps & Sets

## Iterable

- **Technically**: Objects that Implement the **iterable** protocol and have an `@@iterator` method (i.e. `Symbol.iterator`).

- **To us humans**: Objects where you can use the `for..of` loop.

**Note**: Not every iterable is an array! Other iterables are (for example): NodeList, String, Map, Set.

## Array-like Objects

- **Technically**: Objects that have a length property and use indexes to access items.

- **To us humans**: See technical explanation.

**Note**: Not every array-like object is an array! Other array-likes are (for example): NodeList, String.

## Creating Arrays

We have some different ways of creating an array:

- `const array = [1];`
- `const array = Array(1);`
- `const array = new Array(1);`
- `const array = Array.of(1);`
- `const array = Array.from(1);`
- `const array = ['Hi'];`
- `const array = Array('Hi');`
- `const array = new Array('Hi');`
- `const array = Array.of('Hi');`
- `const array = Array.from('Hi');`

First and easiest way of creating an array is: Using a `[]` square brackets:

```js
const array = [15, 8];
console.log(array); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

The second way of creating an array is: Using **array constructor**. For example:

```js
const array2 = new Array(15, 8);
console.log(array2); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

**Warning**: In this way, if you pass a single number, this will be interpreted as the length, for example: `const array3 = new Array(5);`, the output will be different and strange: `[ <5 empty items> ]` or `(5) [empty × 5]`.

**Note**: You can omit the `new` keyword. But you should use the `[]` square brackets instead of that.

Another way of creating an array, is with `Array.of()`. This way works exactly like `[]` square brackets:

```js
const array4 = Array.of(5);
console.log(array4); // [ 5 ]

const array5 = Array.of(15, 8);
console.log(array5); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

**Note**: Now again, you should use `[]` square brackets, this will be slower from a performance perspective than that.

Another special way of creating an array, is with `Array.from()`. If you pass multiple arguments, you will get an error:

```js
const array6 = Array.from(15, 8);
console.log(array6); // TypeError
```

Because you must not pass in multiple arguments here. instead this takes an iterable or an array-like object and that's the interesting thing. `Array.from()` in the end allows you to convert an iterable or an array-like object  which isn't an array yet, to an array. Of course you can pass in an **array** here. for example:

```js
const array7 = Array.from([15, 8]);
console.log(array7); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

It's more interesting if you have an array-like object or an iterable which you want to convert to an array. Let's say here a sting, `"Hi"`; if you pass this into `Array.from()`, you see you get an array where this is **split into separate characters** that make up that array (useful for converting array-like or iterable objects to real arrays):

```js
const array8 = Array.from("Hi");
console.log(array8); // [ 'H', 'i' ]
```

---

You can store numbers, strings and object into the arrays:

- Numbers = `const num = [15, 8];`
- Strings = `const str = ["Hi", "Wellcome"];`
- Objects = `const obj = [{name: "Hamid, age: 23}];`
- Mixed = `const mix = [23, "Hamid", {moreDetail: []}];`

You can also have nested arrays or multi-dimensional arrays, for example:

```js
const nestedArrays = [[15, 8], [22, 26]];
```

Now, how can we (you) access elements with `for` loop? very easy, first we access nested arrays (`[15, 8]` and `[22, 26]`) then we access each of index (elements) of them:

```js
const nestedArrays = [[15, 8], [22, 26]];

for (const data of nestedArrays) {
  for (const dataPoint of data) {
    console.log(dataPoint); // 15 8 22 26
  }
}
```

Be careful how you can use your array, if you pass a number (not array) in front of these two array, you will get an error:

```js
const nestedArrays = [[15, 8], [22, 26], 5];

for (const data of nestedArrays) {
  for (const dataPoint of data) {
    console.log(dataPoint); // TypeError: data is not iterable
  }
}
```

If you see our code, we loop over this array with this outer loop and we have a look at each array element and then we loop over that array element again which works for iterables, but **not for numbers**.

Arrays are index-based, so we can access data by **index**. Index starts at `0` or `zero`, so the first element in an array has an index `0`, second element has an index of `1`, third element has an index of `2` and so on. For example:

```js
const zb = ["Hello", "I'm", 23, "Years", "Old"];
console.log(zb[0]); // "Hello"
console.log(zb[2]); // 23
```

We can't use negative number for this way, for example:

```js
const array = ["hamid", "hamed", "Ali", "Reza"];
console.log(array[-1]); // undefined
```

But it is works in some methods (like `splice()`, and etc.). If you see `-1` result, that means it is a last index. For example, we have `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Here index `-1` is `5`. Or index `-2` is `4` (indeed, reverse indexes).

## Inserting and Removing Elements

We can add elements into the an array with `push`method. This method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. For example:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.push("Ali");
console.log(array); // [ 'Hamid', 'Hamed', 'Ali' ] -- (3)
```

We can also add elements into the an array with `unshift` method (strange name). This method adds one or more elements to the start of an array and returns the new length of the array. For example:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.unshift("Ali");
console.log(array); // [ 'Ali', 'Hamid', 'Hamed' ] -- (3)
```

**Q**: How can we remove the elements?

**Answer**: We can remove an element by `pop()` method, it removes the last element from an array and returns it, for example:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.unshift("Ali");
array.pop(); // `'Hamed'` removed
console.log(array); // [ 'Ali', 'Hamid' ] -- (2)
```

Then we can remove an element by `shift()` method, it removes the first element from an array and returns it, for example:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.unshift("Ali");
array.pop(); // `'Hamed'` removed
array.shift(); // `'Ali'` removed
console.log(array); // [ 'Hamid' ]
```

**Q**: Why doesn't `shift()` add an item and `unshift()` remove it?

**Answer**: Because `unshift()` sounds way more like removing somthing than `shift()`. Well actually, the naming makes sense, what `shift` does is it **shifts** all elements in the array one place **to the left**. That's why the first element gets dropped when we call `shift()`. Now `unshift` on the other hand, **Shifts** all elements **to the right** in the end.

**Warning**: We recommend you to use `push()` and `pop()` methods, because `shift()` and `unshift()` will cost a little bit of performance. Because they shift all elements in left or right in one place (in one time).

## `splice()` Method

`splice()` method helps up insert elements between two elements or removing an element(s).

`splice()` skeleton is:

- The way `splice()` works is that you tell it the **index** where it should start looking, including that index (first parameter)
- Delete as many elements as we will specify (second parameter).
- Insert in place of that element where you start looking.

**Note**: Indeed, `splice()` method, removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.

For example:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.splice(0, 0, "Ali");
console.log(array); // [ 'Ali', 'Hamid', 'Hamed' ]
```

We selecting index `0` for insertion. Then, we said `0` element(s) want to remove. Finally, we pass `"Ali"` into the array (in index `0`).

Now we want put `"Ali"` between `"Hamid"` and `"Hamed"`:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.splice(1, 0, "Ali");
console.log(array); // [ 'Hamid', 'Ali', 'Hamed' ]
```

As you can see, we put `"Ali"` in index `1` (first parameter). Let's try another example, we want put `"Ali"` in place of `"Hamed"` (`"Hamed"` will remove, then `"Ali"` will replace):

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.splice(1, 1, "Ali");
console.log(array); // [ 'Hamid', 'Ali' ]
```

We selected index `1` and said: We want delete one element (`"Hamed"`), then we put `"Ali"`. Another example:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed"];
array.splice(0, 1, "Ali");
console.log(array); // [ 'Ali', 'Hamed' ]
```

Here, we selected the first element (at index `0`) and said: We want delete one element (`"Hamid"`), then we put `"Ali"`.

We can remove all elements by `splice(0)`:

```js
const array = ["Majid", "Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"];
array.splice(0); // []
console.log(array);
```

Another way is:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"];
array.splice(0,2);
console.log(array); // [ 'Ali' ]
```

We selected index `0` then remove two elements (`"Hamid"` and `"Hamed"`).

**Note**: You can add more values (string) in `splice()` arguments:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"];
array.splice(0, 2, "Reza", "Mehrdad", "Majid", "Morteza");
console.log(array); // [ 'Reza', 'Mehrdad', 'Majid', 'Morteza', 'Ali' ]
```

We can also use negative values in `splice()` method:

```js
const array = ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Reza"];
array.splice(-1, 0, "Ali");
console.log(array); // [ 'Hamid', 'Hamed', 'Ali', 'Reza' ]
```

**Note**: Don't use negative number in `deleteCount`, it's not work. Use negative just for index (position),

You need to practice to understand how this method works. We recommned you to use first method (`splice(start, deleteCount, value)`).

## `slice()` Method

As you know, arrays are reference values, consider:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77];
const array2 = array;

console.log(array2); // [ 1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77 ]
```

`array2` is pointing the `array` address. If we the change the `array2`, well that still points at the same address. So, it points at the same changed array. For example:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77];
const array2 = array;

array.push(100);

console.log(array2); // [ 1,  2,  34, -56, 4, 77, 100 ]
```

That's something where `slice()` can help us, because it returns a brand new array based on the old array. (indeed, it brand new address -- make copy of that array). For example:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77];
const array2 = array.slice();

array.push(100);

console.log(array2); // [ 1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77 ]
```

Actually, `slice()` is also really nice for selecting ranges of an array. For example, you want to select a part of your array, not the entire array, but a part:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77];
const array2 = array.slice(0, 3);

console.log(array2); // [ 1, 2, 34 ]
```

We can also use negative numbers in `splice()` method:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77];
const array2 = array.slice(-3, -1);

console.log(array2); // [ -56, 4 ]
```

We selected index `3` (or `-3`) as start. Then we choose index `4` (or `-1`) as end point.

We can pass single number in `slice()`, for example:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77];
const array2 = array.slice(2);

console.log(array2); // [ 34, -56, 4, 77 ]
```

As you can see, we selected index `2` as start point. It's like `[1, )` or `(x, ∞)`.

## `concat()` Method

Here, there is the `concat()` method which we can call. The `concat()` method allows us to concatenate, so to add elements at the of an array.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77];
const array2 = array.concat(1000);

console.log(array2); // [ 1, 2, 34, -56, 4, 77, 1000 ]
```

**Warning**: Some developers think `concat()` method is the same as `push()`, but it doesn't. But why? Answer is here;

```js
// push()
const array = [1, 2, 3];
array.push([4, 5, 6]);
console.log(array); // [ 1, 2, 3, [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]

// concat()
const array = [1, 2, 3];
array.concat([4, 5, 6]);
console.log(array); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

Because it returns a brand new array based on the old array. (indeed, it brand new address -- make copy of that array). You must store it in new variable or constant:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = array.concat([4, 5, 6]);

console.log(newArray); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```

As you can see, `push()` result is `[ 1, 2, 3, [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]` and `concat()` result is `[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]`.

Indeed, `concat()` method combines two or more arrays with an existing array.

## `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` Methods

We also encounter use cases or scenarios where we have an array of data and now we want to find out at which index in that array a certain item sits, consider:

```js
const array = [10, 22, 23, 56, 43, 42, 78];
```

Let's say we want to find out where in this array, with the value of `43` lives. We can find index of `43` with `indexOf()` method:

```js
const array = [10, 22, 23, 56, 43, 42, 78];
console.log(array.indexOf(43)); // 4
```

We also have an optional second argument that would allow us to specify a starting index. For example, only start searching on elements with index `2` or highter:

```js
const array = [10, 22, 23, 56, 43, 42, 78];
console.log(array.indexOf(56, 2)); // 3
// if fail, it will be `-1` as a result
```

If we have the same value more than once, this will stop after it found the first matching value, so it will return us `3`, it will not return us all indexes of all items that have that value.

```js
const array = [10, 22, 23, 56, 43, 42, 56, 78];
console.log(array.indexOf(56, 2)); // 3
```

If you want to search items from right to left, you can use `lastIndexOf()` method:

```js
const array = [10, 22, 23, 56, 43, 42, 56, 78];
console.log(array.indexOf(56)); // 3
console.log(array.lastIndexOf(56)); // 6
```

**Warning**; Only primitive values can use for `indexOf()` or `lastIndexOf()`, references values can't:

```js
const array = [{ name: "Hamid" }, { name: "Hamed" }];
console.log(array.indexOf({ name: "Hamed" })); // -1
```

`-1` means, nothing was found. It doesn't find any match and therefore it returns `-1`.

## `find()` and `findIndex()` and `includes()` Methods

We can fix the previous problem (last example) by `find()` method. It takes a function and that function which it takes three arguments (parameters), first for value, second for index and third for entire array (original one), for example:

```js
const array = [{ name: "Hamid" }, { name: "Hamed" }];

const hamed = array.find((person, index, entireArray) => {
  return (person.name === "Hamed");
});

console.log(hamed); // { name: 'Hamed' }

// you can also use `return (person.name = "Hamed");` - I don' you why
```

`index` and `entireArray` are optional parameters. You can omit them.

**Note**: `find()` doesn't create a copy. It's a reference value:

```js
const array = [{ name: "Hamid" }, { name: "Hamed" }];

const hamed = array.find((person, index, entireArray) => {
  return (person.name === "Hamed");
});

hamed.name = "Ali";

console.log(hamed); // { name: 'Ali' }
```

We can find index instead of their values with `findIndex()` method. It is exatctly like `find()` method:

```js
const array = [{ name: "Hamid" }, { name: "Hamed" }];

const hamed = array.findIndex((person, index, entireArray) => {
  return person.name === "Hamed";
});

console.log(hamed); // 1 -- { name: "Hamed" } is in index `1`
```

We can check the existance of any element of array by `includes()` method:

```js
const array = [10, 22, 23, 56, 43, 42, 78];
console.log(array.includes(25)); // false
console.log(array.includes(23)); // true
```

It's a very short check for existance, with `indexOf()` we could use `indexOf(25 !== -1)`. But `includes()` doesn't need that way, it just returns `true` or `false`.

## `forEach()` Method

Consider:

```js
const prices = [0.99, 1.99, 4.99, 9.99, 49.99, 99.99];
const tax = 0.09;
const taxAdjustedPrices = [];

for (const price of prices) {
  taxAdjustedPrices.push(price * (1 + tax));
}

console.log(taxAdjustedPrices); // [ 1.07, 2.16, 5.43, 10.88, 54.48, 108.98 ]
```

We can do a better way of doing that, using `forEach()` method. It's look like `find()` and `findIndex()` methods. `forEach()` method takes a function and that function which it takes three arguments. First for value, second for index and third for entire array (original one).

```js
const prices = [0.99, 1.99, 4.99, 9.99, 49.99, 99.99];
const tax = 0.09;
const taxAdjustedPrices = [];

prices.forEach((price, idx, array) => { // array parameter not used
  const priceObj = { index: idx, taxAdjPrice: price * (1 + tax) };
  taxAdjustedPrices.push(priceObj);
});

console.log(taxAdjustedPrices);
/*
[
  { index: 0, taxAdjPrice: 1.0791000000000002 },
  { index: 1, taxAdjPrice: 2.1691000000000003 },
  { index: 2, taxAdjPrice: 5.439100000000001 },
  { index: 3, taxAdjPrice: 10.889100000000001 },
  { index: 4, taxAdjPrice: 54.48910000000001 },
  { index: 5, taxAdjPrice: 108.98910000000001 }
]
*/
```

**Note**: You can use both `for..of` loop and `forEach()` method, you are free.

## `map()` Method

This method like `forEach()` method. But it returns a value and brand new array. Now this will replace every element in the array on which we call `map()`, with this adjusted element (`return priceObj;`). However, that's not totally true, it doesn't really replace it. The original array stays untouched, instead it returns a brand new array with a brand new address in memory, where every element has been changed.

```js
const prices = [0.99, 1.99, 4.99, 9.99, 49.99, 99.99];
const tax = 0.09;
const taxAdjustedPrices = prices.map((price, idx, array) => {
  const priceObj = { index: idx, taxAdjPrice: price * (1 + tax) };
  return priceObj;
});
console.log(prices, taxAdjustedPrices);
/*
[ 0.99, 1.99, 4.99, 9.99, 49.99, 99.99 ]

[
  { index: 0, taxAdjPrice: 1.0791000000000002 },
  { index: 1, taxAdjPrice: 2.1691000000000003 },
  { index: 2, taxAdjPrice: 5.439100000000001 },
  { index: 3, taxAdjPrice: 10.889100000000001 },
  { index: 4, taxAdjPrice: 54.48910000000001 },
  { index: 5, taxAdjPrice: 108.98910000000001 }
]
*/
```

`map()` is super easy and useful. Let's make some easier examples:

```js
// return values (the value * 2)
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
const transformedPrice = prices.map((value) => value * 2);
console.log(transformedPrice); // [ 280, 2000, 9000, 7800, 15600, 20000 ]
```

```js
// return index
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
const transformedPrice = prices.map((value, index) =>  index);
console.log(transformedPrice); // [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

```js
// return entire array (for each element)
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
const transformedPrice = prices.map((value, index, array) =>  array);
console.log(transformedPrice);
/*
[
  [ 140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000 ],
  [ 140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000 ],
  [ 140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000 ],
  [ 140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000 ],
  [ 140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000 ],
  [ 140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000 ]
]
*/
```

## `sort()` and `reverse()` Methods

We can sort array values `sort()` method, consider:

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
prices.sort();
console.log(prices); // [ 1000, 10000, 140, 3900, 4500, 7800 ]
```

As you can see, they're not sorted correctly. But why? The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array **in place** (in place algorithm) and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

**Note**: For strings, **only the first character is compared** by default, hence it's **not `"10"` > `"3"`** but `"1"` < `"3"`.

The good thing is we can pass our own function to `sort()`, a function which takes two numbers, a compare function in the end. We can label these parameters `a` and `b`, then name is up to us (you can choose another, for example `x` and `y`):

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
prices.sort((a, b) => {});
console.log(prices); // [ 1000, 10000, 140, 3900, 4500, 7800 ]
```

And what this does is, it excecutes these functions on pairs of elements here and it always gives us these two elements which it's currently compairing and then we should return for that pair of elements which is comparing. Whether `a` so the first value is greater that `b`, if they're equal or if `b` is greater, and then it will swap these two values if needed based on that, and move on to the next pair. So, to one of the values it just swapped and the next value in line. Let's see that in practice, because that will clarify things.

So, here we can add an `if` check in a function, because we will need to return one of three values, **is `a` greater than `b`, are they equal or is `b` greater**?

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
prices.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a > b) {
    return 1;
  } else if (a === b) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return -1;
  }
});

console.log(prices); // [ 140, 1000, 3900, 4500, 7800, 10000 ]
```

As you can see, numbers are sorted very well. We can also use the easier way:

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
prices.sort((a, b) => a - b);

console.log(prices); // [ 140, 1000, 3900, 4500, 7800, 10000 ]
```

Wow, it's amazing, easy and clear. We can use `reverse()` method for reversing sorted array, for example:

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
prices.sort((a, b) => a - b);

console.log(prices.reverse()); // [ 10000, 7800, 4500, 3900, 1000, 140 ]
```

Then we can reverse numbers by first way:

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
prices.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a > b) {
    return -1;
  } else if (a === b) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
});

console.log(prices); // [ 10000, 7800, 4500, 3900, 1000, 140 ]
```

We can avoid to double sorting with this way (with `reverse()` method, we sort the sorted numbers again).

## `filter()` Method

With this method, we can filter numbers, `filter()` method, like other methods, it returns a brand new array with a brand new address in memory, where every element has been changed (the original array stays untouched). It takes a function and that function which it takes three arguments (parameters), first for value, second for index and third for entire array (original one)(like `find()` `forEach()`, `map()` and so on).

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
const filteredArray = prices.filter((price, index, array) => {
  return price > 4000;
});

console.log(filteredArray); // [ 4500, 7800, 10000 ]
```

We can drop the parentheses as you learned and since we only have one expression in there (price), we can even drop the `{}` curly braces, then we also have to remove the `return` statement:

```js
const prices = [140, 1000, 4500, 3900, 7800, 10000];
const filteredArray = prices.filter(price => price > 4000);

console.log(filteredArray); // [ 4500, 7800, 10000 ]
```

## `reduce()` Method

Consider this snippet:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let sum = 0;

const prices = array.forEach((value) => (sum += value));
console.log(sum); // 10
```

We can shorten this code with `reduce()` method. `reduce()` method takes a function and that function which it takes four arguments (parameters), first for previous value, second for current value and third for index and forth for entire array (original one). Consider this example:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = array.reduce((prevValue, currValue, index, array) => {
  return prevValue + currValue;

console.log(sum); // 10
});

// index and entireArray are optional
```

`reduce()` also have optional second parameter, **the initial value**:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = array.reduce((prevValue, currValue, index, array) => {
  return prevValue + currValue;
}, 20);

console.log(sum); // 30
```

If **initial value** is specified, it is used as the **initial value** to start the accumulation. The first call to the **callbackfn** function provides this value as an argument instead of an array value. It means, `20+1+2+3+4 = 30`.

We can use shorthand `reduce()` method:

```js
// #1
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = array.reduce((perv, curr) => perv + curr);
console.log(sum); // 10

// #2
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = array.reduce((perv, curr) => perv + curr, 15);
console.log(sum); // 25
```

## Important

With all these useful array methods you learned about, it's important to understand how you can combine them. Let's take `map()` and `reduce()` as an example:

```js
const originalArray = [{ price: 10.99 }, { price: 5.99 }, { price: 29.99 }];
const transformedArray = originalArray.map((obj) => obj.price); // produces [10.99, 5.99, 29.99]
const sum = transformedArray.reduce((sumVal, curVal) => sumVal + curVal, 0);

console.log(transformedArray); // [ 10.99, 5.99, 29.99 ]
console.log(sum); // 46.97
```

Of course, you could skip the **map** step and just add the extraction logic to `reduce()`:

```js
const originalArray = [{ price: 10.99 }, { price: 5.99 }, { price: 29.99 }];
const sum = originalArray.reduce((sumVal, curVal) => sumVal + curVal.price, 0);

console.log(sum); // 46.97
```

But let's say you have a more complex extraction logic and hence want to split this into multiple method calls. Or you have a re-usable `map()` function which you want to be able to use in different places of your app. Then you can still write the initial example in a more concise way if you **leverage method chaining**:

```js
const originalArray = [{ price: 10.99 }, { price: 5.99 }, { price: 29.99 }];
const sum = originalArray
  .map((obj) => obj.price)
  .reduce((sumVal, curVal) => sumVal + curVal, 0);

console.log(sum); // 46.97
```

We call `.reduce()` directly on the result of `map()` (which produces an array, that's why this is possible). Hence we can avoid storing the mapped array in a separate constant or variable that we might not need in any other place.

## `split()` and `join()` Methods

We can split string into separate values by `split()` method (and store them into the array):

```js
const string = "Hello;my;name;is;hamid;alavi";
const transformedString = string.split(";");
console.log(transformedString); // [ 'Hello', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'hamid', 'alavi' ]
```

As you can see, values are separated by `6`. Indeed, split a string into substrings using the specified separator and return them as an array.

**Note**: You can pass everything you want between text (we used `;`) for spliting them.

We can set a value used to limit the number of elements returned in the array (second parameter):

```js
const string = "Hello;my;name;is;hamid;alavi";
const transformedString = string.split(";", 2);
console.log(transformedString); // [ 'Hello', 'my' ]
```

We can join the multiple elements in the array by `join()` method. A string used to separate one element of an array from the next in the resulting **String**. If omitted, the array elements are separated with a `,` comma.

```js
// #1
const bio = ["Hamid", "Alavi", "is", "a programmer"];
const joinedValue = bio.join(" ");
console.log(joinedValue); // "Hamid Alavi is a programmer"

// #2
const bio = ["Hamid", "Alavi", "is", 23, "years", "old"];
const joinedValue = bio.join(" -- ");
console.log(joinedValue); // "Hamid -- Alavi -- is -- 23 -- years -- old"

// #3
const bio = ["Hamid", "Alavi", "is", 23, "years", "old"];
const joinedValue = bio.join("#*#*#");
console.log(joinedValue); // "Hamid#*#*#Alavi#*#*#is#*#*#23#*#*#years#*#*#old"
```

**Note**: You can use `number`, but it's convert to string at the end:

## `...` Spread Syntax (operator)

Spread syntax (`...`) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.
