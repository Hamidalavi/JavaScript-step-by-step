# How JavaScript Works, The Weird Parts & ES5 vs #ES6+

In this course, you learn about:

- ES5 vs ES6+ Syntax
- How **JavaScript** Works
- The Weird Parts

What is ES mean? ES stands for **ECMAScript**. ECMAScript and therefore **JavaScript** will evolve over the time.

**Note**: ECMA = European Computer Manufacturers Association.

## `var` vs `let` vs `const`

`var` allows us to create variable in the **function** and **global** scope.

`let` does not really use function and **global** scope, although in many cases in behaves exactly like that, but it uses a concept called **block scope** and the same is true for `const`. Let's do this with some examples.

Consider this example:

```js
var name = "Hamid";
var name = "Hamed";
var name = "Ali";
console.log(name); // "Ali"
```

We declared three variables with same name. **JavaScript** automatically executes (choose) the last declared variable (if they are in same name). Actually, the latest variable will override all previous ones.

But it's not works on `let` keyword (or `const`), you will get an error for doing same behavior. For example:

```js
let name = "Hamid";
let name = "Hamed"; // error is here
let name = "Ali";
let name = "Reza";
console.log(name); // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
```

As we mentioned, we said `let` keyword is **block scope**. What is it mean?

Consider:

```js
{
  var name1 = "Hamid";
  let name2 = "Hamed";
}
console.log(name1, name2); // ReferenceError: name2 is not defined -- name1 = "Hamid"
```

As you can see, `let` keyword is just available in `{ .. }` pair. It's a best thing and secure your code.

In other hand, we have **function scope**. In **JavaScript** with `let` and `const` you can define variables or constants in global scope or block scope (local scope) and use them in their own scope. But with `var`, variables are accessible entire the **function scope**. In other words, `var` only knows **global scope** and **function scope**, as we said before, but `let` and `const` knows **block scope**. For example:

```js
function hobby() {
  if (true) {
    var myHobby = "Programming";
  }
  console.log(`My favorite hobby is ${myHobby}`);
}

hobby(); // "My favorite hobby is Programming"
```

Let's try it with `let` and `const` keyword:

```js
function hobby() {
  if (true) {
    let myHobby = "Programming";
  }
  console.log(`My favorite hobby is ${myHobby}`);
}

hobby(); // ReferenceError: myHobby is not defined
```

```js
function hobby() {
  if (true) {
    const myHobby = "Programming";
  }
  console.log(`My favorite hobby is ${myHobby}`);
}

hobby(); // ReferenceError: myHobby is not defined
```

Because `let` and `const` are **block scope**. So don't use `var` anymore.

## Shadowing Variables

You learned about **local** and **global** variables scope in this [link](https://github.com/Hamidalavi/Javascript-tips) and previous section. What happens if you have this code?

```js
let userName = "Hamid";

function User(name) {
  let userName = name;
  console.log(name);
}

userName = "Hamed";
User("Hamid"); // "Hamid"
```

This **will actually show** an output that says `"Hamid"` (not `"Hamed"`). You might've expected that an error gets thrown because we use and declare `userName` more than once - and as you learned, that is not allowed (more info in 2.Basics). Let's see another example:

```js
let name = "Hamid";

function greet() {
  let name = "Ali";
  console.log(name);
}

greet(); // "Ali"
```

If we also change the `name` value, it not works anymore, because that variables (first one) is ignored. For example:

```js
let name = "Hamid";

function greet() {
  let name = "Ali";
  console.log(name);
}

name = "Reza"; // -- edit global vriable
greet(); // "Ali"
```

Here, if we use `var` keyword, we get a same result. What happens if we use `name` twice?

```js
var name = "Hamid";
var name = "Hamed";

function greet() {
  let name = "Ali";
  console.log(name);
}

console.log(name); // "Hamed"

greet(); // "Ali"
```

As you can see,we got `"Hamed"` in output. Because the latest variable will override all previous ones.

## Hoisting

**JavaScript** has a special feature called **hoisting** which in the end means that the **JavaScript** engine, the browser, loads scripts and reads them from top to bottom. For example:

```js
console.log(name);
var name = "Hamid";
//  behind the scene --> undefined
```

As you can see, nothing happened. But if we use `let` keyword, we get an error (as strict mode), for example:

```js
console.log(name);
let name = "Hamid"; // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'name' before initialization
```

`let` and `const` are very useful. If you use `var`, don't use it anymore. Always put your variables and constants at top; if someone want to reads your code, if he/she for example, saw `name` variable in `if` statement and `for` or `while` loops and etc. , generally he/she looks at top of scripts. If `name` not declared at top, he/she must reads entire of script. So, always put variables on top for both **better programming** and **hoisting**. You can use `"use strict"` for check your issues and strict your code (script). For example, if you use pre-reserved keywords, you get an error:

```js
"use strict";
console.log(undefined);
var undefined = "Hamid";
// TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'undefined' of object
```

Or if you didn't declared a variable without `var` or `let` or `const`, **strict mode** will argue that behavior. For example:

```js
"use strict";
name = "Hamid";

console.log(name); // ReferenceError: name is not defined
```

Thankfully `let` and `const` are here. Use them as primary keywords in your projects. Strict mode also good for `function` parameters, for example:

```js
"use strict";
function person(a, a) {
  console.log("Hello");
} // SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context

person();
```

You also get error when use same key in objects;

```js
"use strict";
var o = { p: 1, p: 2 }; // !!! syntax error -- { p: 2 }
console.log(o);
```

This is no longer the case in ECMAScript 2015 (bug). You can see many examples of `use strict` in [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode#Changes_in_strict_mode) link.

## How Code is Parsed and Compiled?

What does execute the script mean?

Quote from [My brother](https://github.com/Hamed2012-dr):

> In **JavaScript** the **interpreter** basically loads our script, reads it, then translates it to byte code which is a bit easier to execute, then it goes ahead and starts running our script (line-by-line). The **interpreter** does not just start executing your script, it also hands off the bye code to the compiler (JiT). So the compiler, whilst the **interpreter** already started execution of your script, now compiles the script to machine code. That's then the fast possible way of executing the script.
>> In **JavaScript Engine**, there are two concepts for executing the code: **Heap** and **Stack**. If you define some functions, **JavaScript** then registers them (you could say it stores them) in the Heap, because functions have a long life typically. Then the browser in the end pushes stuff into our Stack (Stack is basically our short term memory and Heap is the long term memory). The Stack is simply populated by pushing new function calls or new short living data on top of its specific function (`anonymous`) and popping it off when it's not required anymore (after the execution done, (`anonymous`) will popped off). For example:

![image](https://github.com/Hamed2012-dr/Javascript_Notes/raw/master/JavaScript%20Course/Assets/4.jpg)

**Javascript** is a single threaded language. This means it has one call stack and one memory heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next.

## Primitive and Reference Values

- Primitive:
  - Strings
  - Numbers
  - Booleans
  - null
  - undefined
  - Symbol

  For exmple:

  ```js
  let name = "Hamid";
  const PI = 3.14;
  let isLoggedIn = false;
  ...
  ```

- Reference:

  Variables and objects that are referenced (all other objects) For example:

  ```js
  let name = "Hamid";
  let MyFirstName = name; // --> referenced to `name`
  console.log(MyFirstName); // "Hamid"

  MyFirstName = "Hamed";
  console.log(MyFirstName); // "Hamed"
  ```

> Differences of **primitive** and **reference**:

- Primitive:
  - Stored in memory (normally on Stack), variable stores value itself. Because normally these are relatively short living, because **JavaScript** can get rid of them relatively easy.
  - Copying a value (`=` assign to different variable) **copies the value**.

- Reference:
  - Stored in memory (Heap), variable stores a pointer (address) to location in memory. In other words, a `reference` to the object stored in memory (hence **reference value**).
  - Copying a variable (`=` assign to different variable) **copies the pointer / reference**.

More example on `reference` for better understanding:

```js
let array = ["Hamid"];
console.log(array); // [ 'Hamid' ]

let newArray = array;
array.push("Ali");
console.log(newArray); // [ 'Hamid', 'Ali' ]
```

As you can see, the `newArray` is referenced to `array`. We copied the address of that array. So the element itself, the value, the array itself was never duplicated or copied, instead we only copied the address and thet means if we change one array, we automatically change the other array. Because there is nothing like one and the other array, there is only is exactly one array in memory and then both variables hold the same pointer at that place in memory.

This behavior (happens) applies exactly to objects (it's the same for objects). For example:

```js
let human = { name: "hamid", age: 23 };
console.log(human); // { name: 'hamid', age: 23 }

let person = human;
person.age = 24;
console.log(human); // { name: 'hamid', age: 24 }
```

Let's look below snnipet and think about that (learn more in arrays and iterables section), you can copy objects and arrays with a tricky (hacky) way with  `...` spread operator. For example:

```js
let hobbies = ["Programming"];
console.log(hobbies); // [ 'Progeamming' ]

let moreHobbies = [...hobbies];
hobbies.push("Video games");
console.log(moreHobbies); // [ 'Progeamming' ]
```

Let's see another example:

```js
const person1 = { age: 23 };
const person2 = { age: 23 };

console.log(person1 === person2); // false
```

You'll see the result is `false`, so they're not equal. Well now this makes a lot of sense, keep in mind that what we actually stored in `person1` and `person2`, is a pointer at a place in memory and these are two totally different objects, even though they hold the same data but they are two different distinct objects stored in different places, so at the different addresses. **We have two different addresses**. Let's see another example:

```js
const names = ["Hamid", "Hamid"];
names.push("Ali");
console.log(names); // [ 'Hamid', 'Hamid', 'Ali' ]

names = ["Reza, Majid, Mehrdad, Morteza"];
console.log(names); // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

Look at above code, why the second `name = [ .. ]` gets an error?

You can't change primitives stored in constants, because there are not stored in memory and there is no address stored in the constant, but instead the real value is stored in it. In second `name = [ .. ]` we brand new address.

## Garbage Collection and Memory Management

How is memory managed?

(V8's) Garbage Collector: Periodically checks **Heap** for unused objects (objects without reference) and removes unused objects. For example:

```js
let human = { name: "Hamid" }; // this can no longer be used
human = null;
console.log(human); // "null"
```

`let human = { .. }` can no longer be used. If you're not using the variable anymore, that will also be picked up by garbage collector. Garbage collector removes that from memory.

**Note**: Referenced objects can't be garbage collected. Be careful and don't do that (memory leaks). For example:

```js
function addListener() {
  clickableBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
    const value = messageInput.value;
    console.log(value || "Clicked me!");
  });
}

addListenerBtn.addEventListener("click", addListener);
```

Here, if you click on `ClickableBtn` 5 times (for example), 5 new functions will registers in the memory. So when you click on `addListenerBtn`, you will get **5 inputs instead of one**. This is the definition of memory leak. You can fix (memory leak) the previous snippet like this:

```js
function printMessage() {
  const value = messageInput.value;
  console.log(value || "Clicked me!");
}

function addListener() {
  clickableBtn.addEventListener("click", printMessage);
}

addListenerBtn.addEventListener("click", addListener);
```
