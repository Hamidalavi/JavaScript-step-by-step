- Generic Types
- TypeScript Configuration

## What is TS and Why Would We Use it?

**TypeScript** is **JavaScript** but it adds more features, more syntax features we can use. Browsers don't know how to execute **TypeScript**, they know how to execute **JavaScript**. **TypeScript** is a superset to **JavaScript**.

Why would we use it?

- Adds static types
- Adds some new features
- Compiles next-gen **JavaScript** to **old JavaScript**

One of these features is:

```js
// in js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

add("15", "8"); // "158"


// in ts
function add2(a: string, b: string) {
  return a + b;
}

add2("15", "8"); // "158"
```

## Working with TypeScript

First of all, we need to install **TypeScript** with this official website: <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>

You can also use `npm install -g typescript` command in windows. In MAC or GNU/Linux you must use `sudo npm install -g typescript` command to access permission.

To start **TypeScript**, we need to add a new file with `.ts` extension (e.g. `app.ts`).

**TypeScript**, as we mentioned, builds up on **JavaScript**, so generally we can write noraml **JavaScript** code in here. Indeed, any **JavaScript** code works in a **TypeScript** file. But we can then also add certain features which only work in **TypeScript** (i.e. **JavaScript++**).

For example, consider this code:

```ts
// app.ts
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add("15", "8");

console.log(result);
```

We can compile this code into **JavaScript** file with `tsc app.ts` command. `tsc` is for **TypeScript**. After compilation, new file will be created that called `app.js` and now we can use that code for browsers. The interesting part for **TypeScript** is, after compilation, **JavaScript** file also converts to old version, for example:

```js ts
// app.ts
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add("15", "8");

console.log(result);

// now we use `tsc app.ts` command
// app.js created by tsc
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
var result = add("15", "8");
console.log(result); // "158"
```

As we mentioned, **TypeScript** also converts code that runs in older browsers as well, this is a extra benefit we get. So that code above is actually **JavaScript** code which also runs in older browsers.

Let's look at the result above, we got `"153"` as output. But we want to `23` as output, how can we do this?

We can add a type assignment here, for example for parameters. We can make it clear to the **TypeScript** compiler that `a` should be a number and `b` should be a number. We do that by adding a `:` colon after the parameter where we want to assign a type, and then we write the type name (e.g. `number`). It means that `add(a: number, b: number) { .. }`:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(15, 8);

console.log(result);
```

## Extra Features

**TypeScript** has a built-in feature which is called **type inference**. Which means **TypeScript** is really doing its best and it's really smart, about inferring types we're working with. For example, we can write this code:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

// hover over `add()` function => function add(a: number, b: number): number
const result = add(15, 8);

console.log(result);
```

It actually inferred the **return type** of the `add()` function. Since we store the **return value** of the `add()` function in `result`, **TypeScript** also infers that `result` holds the number. So **type inference** is a really a key feature of **TypeScript** as well; and it's a good practice to not unnecessarily reassign a type, **TypeScript** could infer anyways. For example, we don't have to assign the `number` in front of `result` constant:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

const result: number = add(15, 8);

console.log(result);
```

We don't have to add it, **TypeScript** automatically detect that `result` as a `number` type.

## More on Core Types

All types in **TypeScript**:

- `number` type
- `string` type
- `boolean` (boolean, true, false)
- function types (a type of the function as a whole)
- objects types
- `void` type
- `undefined` type
- `any` type
- `null` type
- and so on

> boolean

We have `boolean` type, for example:

```ts
const isDone = false;
// on hover: const isDone: false

let isDone = false;
// on hover: let isDone: boolean
```

As you can see, the second one is changeable, it means that we can change it to `true` in future.

> function, string

We also have **return type** in **TypeScript** language which means that we can return any type in function that called **function type**:

```ts
function add(a, b): string {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add("15", "8");
```

As you can see, we add a `string` type in front of `add()` function. Let's try another example:

```ts
function add(a: string, b: string): string {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add("15", "8");
```

So we have **parameter type** and **return type** (function type) here.

> void, undefined

We can also have functions that don't return anything. Consider:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

const result = add(15, 8);

printResult(result);
```

`printResult()` function doesn't return anything. We can make clear that this function won't return anything by adding a return type of `void` here:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result): void {
  console.log(result);
}

const result = add(15, 8);

printResult(result);
```

That's a type added by **TypeScript** and this basically means this function has no return statement. We can also use `undefined` type instead of `void`. But we getting an error, because technically a function that doesn't return anything, returns `undefined` in **JavaScript**, but in **TypeScript** there is a slight differentiation between these cases. So for a better practice, use `void` type. `undefiend` type is a bad practice.

> any

We can use the `any` type in our code:

```ts
let a; // any type
```

## Extra Features (2)

Another way of working with types and we can override type inference. Consider:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>TypeScript</title>
</head>

<body>
    <input type="text" id="num1">
    <input type="text" id="num2">
    <button>Add</button>
</body>

</html>
```

and

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1");
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2");
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = num1Input.value;
  const num2 = num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);
  printResult(result);
});
```

If we compile this code, we'll get the bad result (string concatination), **TypeScript** doesn't understand the `value` property on `num1Input` and `num2Input`. If you hover over it, you'll see the `any` type. How can we fix this problem?

We only tell **TypeScript** that we select an element in the DOM by `id`Ùˆ but this could be an element; we can have any `id` on any element, it could be a paragraph, it could be a button, it could be a list item, it doesn't have to be an input element. If we hover over `getElementById()`, we indeed see the **TypeScript** only infers that this is of type `HTMLElement`; and that's of course very unspecific, it just means any `HTMLElement`, not specifically an `input` element.

Now we of course know as a developer that we will get an input element (i.e. `HTMLInputElement`) here. **TypeScript** doesn't scan our `index.html` file to check what we're selecting there; so we can't rely on type inference here. Instead we can do something which is known as a type casting. We can override the inference made by **TypeScript**. We can tell **TypeScript** that this will be of a different type. We can use:

```ts
const num1Input: HTMLInputElement = document.getElementById("num1");
const num2Input: HTMLInputElement = document.getElementById("num2");
```

But we still get an error. So instead, we'll use this type casting thing we mentioned, we do that by adding the `as` keyword after the thing, where **TypeScript** infers some type which we want to change and then we set the type we want to use instead of the type **TypeScript** inferred:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
```

This is pure **TypeScript** sytax, this will all be lost once we convert it to **JavaScript**. We can also use `< >` angle brackets in front of the thing we want to cast, instead of after it as we do it with `as` keyword, and then we use the type here:

```ts
const num1Input = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById("num1");
const num2Input = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById("num2");
```

Both works, previous syntax is a bit more common now but both does the same thing in the end.

**Important**: It's important to understand that the value property on an `input` element, always returns a **string**; no matter which type this input (i.e. `<input type="text" id="someid">`) is of. So even if you set this to type `number` here, this doesn't change the type of value you get from the **value prop**, and it also does not change with the value the user entered. If a user enters the number `10` into an input, it's still a `string`, it's wrapped into quotes. **Value always gives you a string**.

We need to parse these:

```ts
const num1 = num1Input.value;
const num2 = num2Input.value;
const result = add(num1, num2);
```

strings to numbers, so we can add a `+` plus in front of both value it rerieves here to cast the string into a number.

```ts
const num1Input = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById("num1");
const num2Input = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById("num2");
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);
  printResult(result);
});
```

Now we get the additions in a mathematical sense instead of the concatenated strings.

## Objects and Arrays and Function Types

> object

Let's dive into a bit more advanced type types. Let's look at objects in general. Consider this example:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);
  const resultContainer: object = { res: result };
  printResult(resultContainer);
});
```

This works, but one problem with this approach is that we don't get the best possible auto completion and type support. If we access `.res` here, we get an error:

```ts
const resultContainer: object = { res: result };
printResult(resultContainer.res); // view error in VsCode
// Property 'res' does not exist on type 'object'.
```

and if we access anything else here, we also get an error. Now for `age`, that makes sense but `res` should definitely work, right? Because we have a `res` property here. Well, the `object` type is very general; it just says it's an object, but we have no information about it.

Instead of using `object` here, we can use `{ }` curly braces here in the type assignment.

```ts
const resultContainer: {res: number} = { res: result };
```

This might look strange at first, because it looks like we are creating an object here. We can now define all the key-value pairs we have in this object. Now if we access `.res` here, we don't get an error.

> array

Now we want to store all the `resultContainer` in an array. Consider:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

let results = [];

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);
  const resultContainer: {res: number} = { res: result };
  results.push(resultContainer);
  printResult(results);
});
```

When we added two numbers here, the addition output then adds (push) to the `results` array. A lot of the times, we don't need that and we want to have one data type in an array. We make that clear in **TypeScript** by adding `[]` square brackets:

```ts
let results: {res: number}[] = [];
```

With that, we're saying: okay, this is an array and the data types in the array will be object of that structure. Now we can't add primitive values:

```ts
results.push(23); //error
```

> function

We can assign a function type by `func: (par1: type, par2: type, n: type) => type`, for example:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);
  const resultContainer: { print: () => void } = {
    print() {
      console.log(result);
    }
  };
  resultContainer.print();
});
```

## Type Alias

We can use type aliases to write type by our own. We can do this with `type` keyword. For example, see the previous code, we can shorten the `resultContainer: { print: () => void } ...`:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

type Fn = { print: () => void };

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);
  const resultContainer: Fn = {
    print() {
      console.log(result);
    }
  };
  resultContainer.print();
});
```

As you can see, we only use the `const resultContainer: Fn ...`. This likes the `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` and other in GNU/Linux.

## Literal, Union and Enums Type

Consider this code:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result, printMode: string) {
  if (printMode === "console") {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === "alert") {
    alert(result);
  }
}

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);

  printResult(result, "console");
  printResult(result, "alert");
});
```

Let's analyze `printResult()` function:

```ts
function printResult(result, printMode: string) {
  if (printMode === "console") {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === "alert") {
    alert(result);
  }
}
```

We call this **literal type** that we wrote `console` and `alert` as a string type and we called the `printResult()` function twice for `console` and `alert`.

We can make this easier by **union type**, for example:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

function printResult(result, printMode: "console" | "alert") {
  if (printMode === "console") {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === "alert") {
    alert(result);
  }
}

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);

  printResult(result, "console");
  printResult(result, "alert");
});
```

Let's analyze `printResult()` function:

```ts
function printResult(result, printMode: "console" | "alert") {
  if (printMode === "console") {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === "alert") {
    alert(result);
  }
}
```

This creates a **union type** which means multiple types of values are allowed, in this case for `printMode` parameter, either `console` (literal type) and `alert`; any other string will not be allowed. The advantage is that now for us, we get better auto completion in the IDE (in VsCode for example). We can also use type alias for that, for example:

```ts
type PrintMode = "console" | "alert";

function printResult(result, printMode: PrintMode) {
  if (printMode === "console") {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === "alert") {
    alert(result);
  }
}
```

We can also use union type with main types and that's amazing, for example:

```ts
// see the result parameter
function printResult(result: number | string, printMode: PrintMode) {
  if (printMode === "console") {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === "alert") {
    alert(result);
  }
}
```

If we have multiple choices we want to use in our code, multiple mode or something like this, then we can always use an `unum` keyword:

```ts
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num1") as HTMLInputElement;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2") as HTMLInputElement;
const addBtn = document.querySelector("button");

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

enum OutputMode {CONSOLE, ALERT}

function printResult(result: number | string, printMode: OutputMode) {
  if (printMode === OutputMode.CONSOLE) {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === OutputMode.ALERT) {
    alert(result);
  }
}

addBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const num1 = +num1Input.value;
  const num2 = +num2Input.value;
  const result = add(num1, num2);

  printResult(result, OutputMode.CONSOLE);
  printResult(result, OutputMode.ALERT);
});
```

This `enum OutputMode {CONSOLE, ALERT}` code is easy to read for us humans, but it's very complex behind the scenes (in `app.js` file), then we get this following code in `app.js` file:

```js
var num1Input = document.getElementById("num1");
var num2Input = document.getElementById("num2");
var addBtn = document.querySelector("button");
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
var OutputMode; // <-- see this line
(function (OutputMode) {
  OutputMode[(OutputMode["CONSOLE"] = 0)] = "CONSOLE";
  OutputMode[(OutputMode["ALERT"] = 1)] = "ALERT";
})(OutputMode || (OutputMode = {}));
function printResult(result, printMode) {
  if (printMode === OutputMode.CONSOLE) {
    console.log(result);
  } else if (printMode === OutputMode.ALERT) {
    alert(result);
  }
}
addBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  var num1 = +num1Input.value;
  var num2 = +num2Input.value;
  var result = add(num1, num2);
  printResult(result, OutputMode.CONSOLE);
  printResult(result, OutputMode.ALERT);
});
```

## Classes and Interfaces

Consider this code:

```ts
class User {
  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

We get an error, that says **Property 'name' (and 'age') does not exist on type 'User'**. In vanilla **JavaScript**, this would be a valid syntax we could use, not so **TypeScript**. Instead there, we have to add properties as fields all the time (every time we want to work with a property). For example:

```ts
class User {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

It forces us this setup, because this in the end, just leads to cleaner code.

**TypeScript** also gives us access modifiers, we can make it clear whether a property is intended to be used from only inside the class or also from outside of it. We could lock down the `age` to be used from only inside by adding `private`:

```ts
class User {
  name: string;
  private age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

We can also write like this:

```ts
class User {
  constructor(public name: string, private age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

That's simply a special feature available in the constructor of a class. By doing this, we tell **TypeScript** these parameters should also be automatically converted to properties.

## Interfaces

Kind of related to classes but also different is a **TypeScript** exclusive feature called **interfaces**. When we define a class, we have a blueprint for an object and we can always instantiate a class as we're doing it down there:

```ts
const user = new User("Hamid", 23);
```

Sometimes we just want a blueprint but we don't want to instantiate in, because it's very simple, it doesn't have any methods and we just don't want to call new and create an object (like `new User("Hamid", 23)`), but create it with `{}` curly braces and still have that extra type safety. We can use **interfaces** as a `type`, for example:

```ts
// interface
interface CalculationResults {
  res: string;
  print(): void;
}

// type
type CalculationResults = {
  res: string;
  print(): void;
}
```

**Q**: So, why do we have interfaces? If they're just an alternative to the type keyboard?

**Answer**: Besides using them for object type definitions, we can also use them as contracts in classes. For example:

```ts
interface Greetful {
  name: string;
}

class User implements Greetful {
  constructor(public name: string, private age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

Now in code above, it forces this `User` class to have a public `name` property which is of type `string`. If we would remove the `name` property, we get an error. We can also use multiple interfaces:

```ts
interface Greetful {
  name: string;
}

interface Age {
  age: number;
}

class User implements Greetful, Age {
  constructor(public name: string,public age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

Why we do this? Because it forces to our teamworkers to have a one and centralized purpose.

## Generic Types

Consider this simple function:

```ts
function logAndEcho(val: any) {
  console.log(val);
  return val;
}

logAndEcho("Hamid Alavi");
```

This could be a generic function. Now here, we accept `any` type of data, but then we don't get any extra **TypeScript** support. If we want to do `logAndEcho("Hamid Alavi").split(" ");`, we can't do that. Because **TypeScript** doesn't know what `logAndEcho()` returns, it returns anythin, because we set the value type to `any` here.

So, that's where gereric types can help us. We can create a generic function in this case. We do that by adding `< >` angled brackets after the function name (before the parameter list) and then typically we use `<T>` as a placeholder for the type. Then we say `val` is also of type `<T>`:

```ts
function logAndEcho<T>(val: T) {
  console.log(val);
  return val;
}

logAndEcho("Hamid Alavi").split(" ");
```

**Note**: You can use any identifier you want. But `<T>` is what you'd see most often.

Other generic types are like:

```ts
type CalculationResults = CalculationContainer[];


logAndEcho("Hamid Alavi").split(" ");

const result: Array<CalculationContainer> = [];
```

## TypeScript Configuration

1. We can compile any **TypeScript** code and convert it into a **JavaScript** code with `tsc file-name.ts` command.

2. We can use auto compilation with `tsc file-name.ts -w` command. It enables the watch mode (real-time compilation).

3. We can use `tsc --init` command to create a configuration file. Then we can run just `tsc` command to compile all **TypeScript** file in a second.

**Note**: If you get an error, then you have an error with your DOM elements (for example, inputs or buttons). To solve this problem, after the selecting the DOM, use `!` mark. For example:

```js
const num1Input = document.getElementById("num2")!;
const num2Input = document.getElementById("num2")! as HTMLInputElement;
```

By doing this, we can ignoring the `null` value of DOM (and other values).
