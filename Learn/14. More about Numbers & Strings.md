## Numbers

In **JavaScript** every number is a **float** (a number with decimal places). Unlike other programming languages, **JavaScript** does not know special integer (`int`) type. Numbers are stored as 64-bit floating points in **JavaScript**.

In **JavaScript** there is a limitation in maximum and minimum value. We can see the biggest and smallest non-decimal value (integer) with `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` properties, for example:

```js
console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991 -- Math.pow(2, -53) - 1
console.log(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER); // -9007199254740991 -- 1
```

That's nine quadrillion.

We can also see the max and min value (not integer, but the biggest and smallest) with `MAX_VALUE` and `MIN_VALUE` properties:

```js
console.log(Number.MAX_VALUE); // 1.7976931348623157e+308
console.log(Number.MIN_VALUE); // 5e-324
```

- `MAX_VALUE`: The largest number that can be represented in **JavaScript**. Equal to approximately 1.79E+308.
- `MIN_VALUE`: The closest number to zero that can be represented in **JavaScript**. Equal to approximately 5.00E-324.

## Decimal Numbers

Consider:

```js
let result = 0.4 + 0.2;
console.log(result === 0.6); // false
```

Wait... What happens here? As you know, the **JavaScript** converts this number to the binary system for doing the calculation, and then converts it back to give us the output that makes sense to us humans. Because we rather work with the decimal system than with the binary system.
