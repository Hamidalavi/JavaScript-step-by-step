## What is Browser Support

Consider an application where you're writing some **JavaScript** code and you want to use the `fetch()` API. You want to send an HttpRequest with that `fetch()` API. You as a developer want to use this API, because it's nice to use, it is promise based out of the box. It's easier to use than `XMLHttpRequest` in many reards and you might not want to use a third-party library like **axios**. So therefore you decide to use the `fetch()` API.

Now the problem is that **you can't control which browser your users use**. There are many browsers for Desktop and IOS and Android with different versions. For example, `fetch()` API would be supported in Chrome since 2015 already; in Firefox also since 2015 but not in Internet Explorer. Edge is supporting this since 2016 and Safari is also supporting it since 2017.

## Browser Features vs JavaScript Syntax

||Kind of related but not the same!||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Browser Features (**Browser APIs**)||**JavaScript** Syntax|
|The browser **decides** which features it offers||The browser’s **JavaScript** engine defines which **JavaScript** syntax / version is supported|
|Examples: `fetch()`, `geolocation`, DOM API, ...||Examples: `let`, `const`, `async` / `await`, Promises, ...|
|↓||↓|
|Implemented individually||Implemented individually or in chunks (e.g. **ES6**)|

Not all browsers support all features - and support changes all the time in modern (**“evergreen”**) browsers. Legacy browsers (e.g. IE8) do not receive new features anymore.

What is **evergreen** and **legacy** browsers:

- **Evergreen**: Browser will updates itself behind the scene.
- **Legacy**: We must update the browser manually.

## Which Browser Support Do You Need?

Many developers think that they make an application and web page that **support all browsers and all browser versions**. You do this guys and girls. If you think like them, you need to ship too much code, pass up on some features and improvements. Please think and analyse your market! Who will be your users?

If:

- Internal tool / app: Company browser might be clearly defined.
- Tech-savvy users: Very likely to use cutting-edge browsers and versions.
- Older people, non-techsavvy audience: Likely to use older browsers.

For example, when you are in the X company, you know that what they want and you create an appication for your company's users. But if you want to make an application for other users (i.e out of company), you need to be aware of that your using code method (e.g `fetch()` API and modern syntaxes).

Finally, **don't use the older syntaxes**, learn them, but don't use them; because as we mentioned, you need to ship too much code, pass up on some features and improvements. You can use traspilation methods (we cover it later).

For example, let's work with copy and paste API (clipboard):

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const paragraphText = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = paragraphText.textContent;
  navigator.clipboard
    .writeText(text)
    .then((result) => console.log(result))
    .catch((error) => console.log(error));
});
```

It works in Firefox and Chrome browsers and it doesn't works in Safari and Edge (it works now) and Internet Explorer browsers. We can use a tricky method for this problem, add a `if` statement:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const paragraphText = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = paragraphText.textContent;
  if (navigator.clipboard) {
    navigator.clipboard
      .writeText(text)
      .then((result) => console.log(result))
      .catch((error) => console.log(error));
  }
});
```

If the `navigator.clipboard` exists, then we can work with that. If it doesn't exists, we can ignore this issue.

It means that if you go to Safari and you click `copy` button, you don't get an error anymore.

Now we can provide some fallback code for browsers where it is not supported, simply by providing `else` branch here; and then the simplest fallback would be that we show an error message:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const paragraphText = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = paragraphText.textContent;
  if (navigator.clipboard) {
    navigator.clipboard
      .writeText(text)
      .then((result) => console.log(result))
      .catch((error) => console.log(error));
  } else {
    console.log("Feature not available, please copy manually!");
  }
});
```

Summary:

- `navigator.clipboard` available => Execute code and use feature
- `navigator.clipboard` not available => Execute fallback code, show error message
