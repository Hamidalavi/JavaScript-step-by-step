# More about Functions

In this course, you learn about:

- Pure Functions & Side Effects
- Factory Functions
- Closures & Scope Revisited
- Recursion

## Pure and Impure Functions

A pure function is a function which for some given input. For some given arguments, always produces the same output (if we reload the page) and it also does not trigger any side effects; which means it does not change anything outside of the function. For example:

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(add(15, 8)); // 23
```

This is a perfect example for a pure function. It does not change anything outside of function and it always produces the same result for the same outputs.

We also have a impure function that if we call this function, we get the different results there every time we reload the page. For example:

```js
function add(num) {
  return num + Math.random();
}

console.log(add(23)); // 23.????????
```

## Side Effeccts

Let's declare a variable and create a function:

```js
let previousResult = 0

function add(num1, num2) {
  const sum = num1 + num2;
  previousResult = sum;
  return sum;
}
```

This function here would not be pure, because the side effect is `previousResult = sum`. We change a variable that is defined outside of the function (i.e. this function changes something).
