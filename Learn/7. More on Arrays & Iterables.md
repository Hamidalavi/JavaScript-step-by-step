# Arrays & Iterables - Lists of Data

In this course, you learn about:

- Different Ways of Creating Arrays
- Working with Arrays
- Important Array Methods
- Other Iterables: Maps & Sets

## Iterable

- **Technically**: Objects that Implement the **iterable** protocol and have an `@@iterator` method (i.e. `Symbol.iterator`).

- **To us humans**: Objects where you can use the `for..of` loop.

**Note**: Not every iterable is an array! Other iterables are (for example): NodeList, String, Map, Set.

## Array-like Objects

- **Technically**: Objects that have a length property and use indexes to access items.

- **To us humans**: See technical explanation.

**Note**: Not every array-like object is an array! Other array-likes are (for example): NodeList, String.

## Creating Arrays

We have some different ways of creating an array:

- `const array = [1];`
- `const array = Array(1);`
- `const array = new Array(1);`
- `const array = Array.of(1);`
- `const array = Array.from(1);`
- `const array = ['Hi'];`
- `const array = Array('Hi');`
- `const array = new Array('Hi');`
- `const array = Array.of('Hi');`
- `const array = Array.from('Hi');`

First and easiest way of creating an array is: Using a `[]` square brackets:

```js
const array = [15, 8];
console.log(array); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

The second way of creating an array is: Using **array constructor**. For example:

```js
const array2 = new Array(15, 8);
console.log(array2); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

**Warning**: In this way, if you pass a single number, this will be interpreted as the length, for example: `const array3 = new Array(5);`, the output will be different and strange: `[ <5 empty items> ]` or `(5) [empty × 5]`.

**Note**: You can omit the `new` keyword. But you should use the `[]` square brackets instead of that.

Another way of creating an array, is with `Array.of()`. This way works exactly like `[]` square brackets:

```js
const array4 = Array.of(5);
console.log(array4); // [ 5 ]

const array5 = Array.of(15, 8);
console.log(array5); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

**Note**: Now again, you should use `[]` square brackets, this will be slower from a performance perspective than that.

Another special way of creating an array, is with `Array.from()`. If you pass multiple arguments, you will get an error:

```js
const array6 = Array.from(15, 8);
console.log(array6); // TypeError
```

Because you must not pass in multiple arguments here. instead this takes an iterable or an array-like object and that's the interesting thing. `Array.from()` in the end allows you to convert an iterable or an array-like object  which isn't an array yet, to an array. Of course you can pass in an **array** here. for example:

```js
const array7 = Array.from([15, 8]);
console.log(array7); // [ 15, 8 ]
```

It's more interesting if you have an array-like object or an iterable which you want to convert to an array. Let's say here a sting, `"Hi"`; if you pass this into `Array.from()`, you see you get an array where this is **split into separate characters** that make up that array (useful for converting array-like or iterable objects to real arrays):

```js
const array8 = Array.from("Hi");
console.log(array8); // [ 'H', 'i' ]
```

---

You can store numbers, strings and object into the arrays:

- Numbers = `const num = [15, 8];`
- Strings = `const str = ["Hi", "Wellcome"];`
- Objects = `const obj = [{name: "Hamid, age: 23}];`
- Mixed = `const mix = [23, "Hamid", {moreDetail: []}];`

You can also have nested arrays or multi-dimensional arrays, for example:

```js
const nestedArrays = [[15, 8], [22, 26]];
```

Now, how can we (you) access elements with `for` loop? very easy, first we access the nested arrays (`[15, 8]` and `[22, 26]`) then get access the each of index (elements) of them:

```js
const nestedArrays = [[15, 8], [22, 26]];

for (const data of nestedArrays) {
  for (const dataPoint of data) {
    console.log(dataPoint); // 15 8 22 26
  }
}
```

Be careful how you can use your array, if you pass a number (not array) in front of these two array, you will get an error:

```js
const nestedArrays = [[15, 8], [22, 26], 5];

for (const data of nestedArrays) {
  for (const dataPoint of data) {
    console.log(dataPoint); // SyntaxError: Unexpected number
  }
}
```

If you see our code, we loop over this array with this outer loop and we have a look at each array element and then we loop over that array element again which works for iterables, but **not for numbers**.
