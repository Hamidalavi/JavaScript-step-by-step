## What is Browser Support

Consider an application where you're writing some **JavaScript** code and you want to use the `fetch()` API. You want to send an HttpRequest with that `fetch()` API. You as a developer want to use this API, because it's nice to use, it is promise based out of the box. It's easier to use than `XMLHttpRequest` in many reards and you might not want to use a third-party library like **axios**. So therefore you decide to use the `fetch()` API.

Now the problem is that **you can't control which browser your users use**. There are many browsers for Desktop and IOS and Android with different versions. For example, `fetch()` API would be supported in Chrome since 2015 already; in Firefox also since 2015 but not in Internet Explorer. Edge is supporting this since 2016 and Safari is also supporting it since 2017.

## Browser Features vs JavaScript Syntax

Not all browsers support all features - and support changes all the time in modern (**“evergreen”**) browsers. Legacy browsers (e.g. IE8) do not receive new features anymore.

What is **evergreen** and **legacy** browsers:

- **Evergreen**: Browser will updates itself behind the scene.
- **Legacy**: We must update the browser manually.

## Which Browser Support Do You Need?

Many developers think that they make an application and web page that **support all browsers and all browser versions**. You do this guys and girls. If you think like them, you need to ship too much code, pass up on some features and improvements. Please think and analyse your market! Who will be your users?

If:

- Internal tool / app: Company browser might be clearly defined.
- Tech-savvy users: Very likely to use cutting-edge browsers and versions.
- Older people, non-techsavvy audience: Likely to use older browsers.

For example, when you are in the X company, you know that what they want and you create an appication for your company's users. But if you want to make an application for other users (i.e out of company), you need to be aware of that your using code method (e.g `fetch()` API and modern syntaxes).

Finally, **don't use the older syntaxes**, learn them, but don't use them; because as we mentioned, you need to ship too much code, pass up on some features and improvements. You can use traspilation methods (we cover it later).

For example, let's work with copy and paste API (clipboard):

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const paragraphText = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = paragraphText.textContent;
  navigator.clipboard
    .writeText(text)
    .then((result) => console.log(result))
    .catch((error) => console.log(error));
});
```

It works in Firefox and Chrome browsers and it doesn't works in Safari and Edge (it works now) and Internet Explorer browsers. We can use a tricky method for this problem, add a `if` statement:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const paragraphText = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = paragraphText.textContent;
  if (navigator.clipboard) {
    navigator.clipboard
      .writeText(text)
      .then((result) => console.log(result))
      .catch((error) => console.log(error));
  }
});
```

If the `navigator.clipboard` exists, then we can work with that. If it doesn't exists, we can ignore this issue.

It means that if you go to Safari and you click `copy` button, you don't get an error anymore.

Now we can provide some fallback code for browsers where it is not supported, simply by providing `else` branch here; and then the simplest fallback would be that we show an error message:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const paragraphText = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = paragraphText.textContent;
  if (navigator.clipboard) {
    navigator.clipboard
      .writeText(text)
      .then((result) => console.log(result))
      .catch((error) => console.log(error));
  } else {
    console.log("Feature not available, please copy manually!");
  }
});
```

Summary:

- `navigator.clipboard` available => Execute code and use feature
- `navigator.clipboard` not available => Execute fallback code, show error message

## Polyfills

Consider the promises, (Third-party) **JavaScript** code which adds an unsupported feature to the browser (for this script execution). Only possible for some features (i.e. where you can re-create the missing functionality).

## Transpilation

Sometimes, polyfills and fallback code codes are not enough for ignoring errors. For example, `let`, `const`, arrow function, `async` / `await` and so on, are not support in the IE browser and we need to use **transpiler** to solve that.

**Transpile**: Convert **modern** code to **older** code. (transform + compile).

Third-party tools like **Babel** convert our code to code that works in older browsers as well. We can install it with `npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env` command and use it.

In the end, what we got here is:

- `babel-loader`: Which is the integration to webpack, which basically does the connection of webpack and the babel tool.
- `@babel/core`: Which is that babel tool; so the tool that actually knows how to tanslate modern code to older code.
- `@babel/preset-env`: Controls which features are compiled in which way (i.e. translation rules).

We can use this packages with adding this following code to `webpack.config.js` file:

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.m?js$/,
      exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
      use: {
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then:

```js
const path = require("path");
const CleanPlugin = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts"),
    publicPath: "assets/scripts/"
  },
  devtool: "cheap-module-eval-source-map",
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            presets: ["@babel/preset-env"]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [new CleanPlugin.CleanWebpackPlugin()]
};
```

We can remove the `bower_components` from this file (we don't have it yet). `test: /\.m?js$/` means that any file ending with `.js` or `.mjs` (i.e. with an extension of `js` or `mjs`), should be treated or should be handled by this rule. Other files ending with a different extension of which we have none but if we had them, would be ignored.

**Note**: We also have to add this code in `webpack.config.prod.js` file.

That's not the end, we must add the `browserlist` entry in `package.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "javascript-complete-guide",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "JavaScript - The Complete Guide",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack",
    "build:dev": "webpack-dev-server",
    "build:prod": "webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "browserlist": "> 2%",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.12.3",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.12.1",
    "babel-loader": "^8.1.0",
    "clean-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.0",
    "webpack": "^4.44.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

For example, if we build a new `app.js` file (with `npm run build` command), we see the a modern code like:

```js
const button = ....
```

If we use `> 0.2%` instead of `> 2%`, we will get:

```js
var button = ...
```

Let's check out the **ES6** / **JavaScript** Compat Table - <https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esnext/> for this percent of usage (have a market share of greater `n%`).

We can also combine multiple queries or multiple instructions; for example, we can add `not dead`, this means only browsers that still have official support (e.g. IE v.10 is dead and IE.11 is at least receiving some support still).

```json
{
  "name": "javascript-complete-guide",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "JavaScript - The Complete Guide",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack",
    "build:dev": "webpack-dev-server",
    "build:prod": "webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "browserslist": "> 0.2%, not dead",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.12.3",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.12.1",
    "babel-loader": "^8.1.0",
    "clean-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.0",
    "webpack": "^4.44.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

**Important**: You can use `browserslist` instead of `browserlist` entry.

The transpilation is done, but some broblems are still here, for example, babel can't convert prommises to older version (or remove them), to solve this problem, we can add `core-js` third-party package. We can add it with `npm install --save core-js` (don't use `-dev`, because it's a third-party package). Then we import it in our main **JavaScript** file, then we run the build:dev script:

```js
import "core-js"

const button = document.querySelector("button");
const paragraphText = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = paragraphText.textContent;
  if (navigator.clipboard) {
    navigator.clipboard
      .writeText(text)
      .then((result) => console.log(result))
      .catch((error) => console.log(error));
  } else {
    console.log("Feature not available, please copy manually!");
  }
});

// then
npm run build:dev
```

If we go to the **Network** tab in developer tools, we see that the `app.js` file is bigger than that we had before (e.g. `2.1mb` instead of `899kb`). We can solve and optimize this code with `import "core-js/features/promise"` (e.g. `1.1mb` instead of `899kb`).

We can use babel for auto polyfilling for us. For that we remove the `import` and:

```js
presets: [["@babel/preset-env", { useBuiltIns: false }]]
```

The `useBuiltIns` option, is the option that allows us to control polyfilling behavior. The default is `false`, which means no polyfills are added automatically. We can set that to `"usage"` or to `"entry"`. With `"entry"`, we manually need to add polyfill imports; and with `"usage"`, it checks which feature our code is using and then it will add imports for these features polyfills automatically.

If you want to use the `"entry"`, you need to install **regenerator-runtime** package (with `npm install --save regenerator-runtime` command) and import two code in your main **JavaScript** file:

```js
import "core-js/stable";
import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";
```

You also need to add the `corejs` option in your `webpack.config.js` and `webpack.config.prod.js` files:

```js
const path = require("path");
const CleanPlugin = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development", // and production
  entry: "src/app.js",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "assets", "scripts"),
    publicPath: "assets/scripts/"
  },
  devtool: "cheap-module-eval-source-map",
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        exclude: /(node_modules)/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            presets: [
              [
                "@babel/preset-env",
                { useBuiltIns: "entry", corjs: { version: 3 } }
              ]
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [new CleanPlugin.CleanWebpackPlugin()]
};
```

If you use it, the output **JavaScript** file size will bigger than you think. Because it brings you the whole features in those browsers (in `browserslist` entry). If you use `"usage"` babel checks which feature our code is using and then it will add imports for these features polyfills automatically.

## Some Notes Before The End

We can use fallback in our html file. For example, older browser, don't support the `type="module"`, we can easily add the tag with `nomodule` attribute.

Or we can use `<noscript></noscript>` tag for who that his/her browser doesn't supports the **JavaScript**:

```html
<noscript>
  Please enable JavaScript to use this page!
</noscript>
```

**Important**: If you get some projects, and you see the `webpack.config.js` (and other config files) in those sources, make sure that you add `node_modules` (with `npm install` command) folder in that project. Or optimize your files with `npm run build` command (webpack).
