## Local Storage

Let's start with local storage. Local storage is a great, easy to use key-value storage where we can store basic data.

We can access to the local storage with by just typing `localStorage`. It's part of the `window` object, but as you learned, we can omit this.

We can set a local storage with `setItem()` method, for example:

```js
const userId = "u123";
localStorage.setItem("uid", userId);
```

If you go to the **Application** tab in browser developer tools, you see the key-value data in local storage.

We can also delete (with `delete` or `backspace` key) and edit this data in local storage.

Now we can get an item from the local storage with `getItem()` method, for example:

```js
const storeBtn = document.getElementById("store-btn");
const retrBtn = document.getElementById("retrieve-btn");

const userId = "u123";

storeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => localStorage.setItem("uid", userId));
retrBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const extractedId = localStorage.getItem("uid");

  if (extractedId) {
    console.log(`Got the id - ${extractedId}`);
  } else {
    console.log("Couldn't find id!");
  }
});
```
