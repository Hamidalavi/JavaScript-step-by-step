# JavaScript Conditions

## Boolean Operators

|Operator|Description|Example|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`==`|Check for value equality|`a == b`|
|`!=`|Check for value inequality|`a != b`|
|`===` and `!==`|Check for value **and** type (in)equality|`a === b` / `a !== b`|
|`>` and `<`|Check for value being greater / smaller|`a > b` / `a < b`|
|`>=` and `<=`|Check for value being greater or equal / smaller or equal|`a >= b` / `a <= b`|
|`!`|Check if **note** true|`!a`|

One of most using statement for conditions, is `if` statement. Always keep in mind that condition in `if (condition) { .. }` simply has to be a **boolean value**.

Often, you'll **generate** such a boolean value with the help of `===,` `>`, `<` etc. **All these operators yield boolean values** (without changing the variables / values you're using them on).

Since `if` only wants a boolean, you of course don't have to use such an operator. If you already got a variable that holds a boolean, you can use it without any extra operator. For example:

```js
const isTrue = true;
if (isTrue) {
    console.log("OK!"); // "OK!"
}
```

You could write:

```js
const isTrue = true;
if (isTrue === true) {
    console.log("OK!"); // "OK!"
}
```

But that would be **redundant**. You'd generate another new boolean where you already got one.

You can use the `!` operator to negate (**invert**) the value:

```js
const isTrue = true;
if (!isTrue) {
    // This code will NOT execute because isTrue is true but ! inverts it (in this check)
} else {
    // This would execute because !isTrue yields false => else block executes
}
```

Again, that would be similar to:

```js
const isTrue = true;
if (isTrue !== true) {
    // This would NOT execute
} else {
    // This would execute because isTrue is true and hence !== true yields false
}
```

But again, that would be **redundant**.

## String Conditions

Strings can also be compared with greater than (`>`) or lower / smaller than (`<`) operators. **JavaScript** compares strings based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. That means that `b` is greater than `a` for example.

**JavaScript** always looks at the first character and only considers other characters if the first character is similar. In addition, **capital characters** are considered to be **smaller than** lowercase characters. See these exmples:

```js
console.log('ab' > 'aa'); // true
console.log('a' > 'B'); // true
console.log('a' > 'b'); // false
```

## Object Conditions

`object`s and `array`s are special. For example:

```js
let obj1 = {name: "Hamid"};
let obj2 = {name: "Hamid"};

console.log(obj1 == obj2); // false
console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false

console.log(obj1 != obj2); // true
console.log(obj1 !== obj2); // true
```

But if you access their properties, you get `true` from output:

```js
let obj1 = {name: "Hamid"};
let obj2 = {name: "Hamid"};

console.log(obj1.name == obj2.name); // true
console.log(obj1.name === obj2.name); // true

console.log(obj1.name != obj2.name); // false
console.log(obj1.name !== obj2.name); // false
```

These are some reason that they are (objects) special. These also come true with `array`s. For example:

```js
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(array1 == array2); // false
console.log(array1 === array2); // false

console.log(array1 != array2); // true
console.log(array1 !== array2); // true
```
