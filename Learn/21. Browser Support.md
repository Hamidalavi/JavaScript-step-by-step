## What is Browser Support

Consider an application where you're writing some **JavaScript** code and you want to use the `fetch()` API. You want to send an HttpRequest with that `fetch()` API. You as a developer want to use this API, because it's nice to use, it is promise based out of the box. It's easier to use than `XMLHttpRequest` in many reards and you might not want to use a third-party library like **axios**. So therefore you decide to use the `fetch()` API.

Now the problem is that **you can't control which browser your users use**. There are many browsers for Desktop and IOS and Android with different versions. For example, `fetch()` API would be supported in Chrome since 2015 already; in Firefox also since 2015 but not in Internet Explorer. Edge is supporting this since 2016 and Safari is also supporting it since 2017.

## Browser Features vs JavaScript Syntax

||Kind of related but not the same!||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Browser Features (**Browser APIs**)||**JavaScript** Syntax|
|The browser **decides** which features it offers||The browser’s **JavaScript** engine defines which **JavaScript** syntax / version is supported|
|Examples: `fetch()`, `geolocation`, DOM API, ...||Examples: `let`, `const`, `async` / `await`, Promises, ...|

|Implemented individually||Implemented individually or in chunks (e.g. **ES6**)|

Not all browsers support all features - and support changes all the time in modern (**“evergreen”**) browsers. Legacy browsers (e.g. IE8) do not receive new features anymore.

What is **evergreen** and **legacy** browsers:

- **Evergreen**: Browser will updates itself behind the scene.
- **Legacy**: We must update the browser manually.
