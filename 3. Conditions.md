## Boolean Operators

|Operator|Description|Example|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`==`|Check for value equality|`a == b`|
|`!=`|Check for value inequality|`a != b`|
|`===` and `!==`|Check for value **and** type (in)equality|`a === b` / `a !== b`|
|`>` and `<`|Check for value being greater / smaller|`a > b` / `a < b`|
|`>=` and `<=`|Check for value being greater or equal / smaller or equal|`a >= b` / `a <= b`|
|`!`|Check if **note** true|`!a`|

One of most using statement for conditions, is `if` statement. Always keep in mind that condition in `if (condition) { .. }` simply has to be a **boolean value**.

Often, you'll **generate** such a boolean value with the help of `===,` `>`, `<` etc. **All these operators yield boolean values** (without changing the variables / values you're using them on).

Since `if` only wants a boolean, you of course don't have to use such an operator. If you already got a variable that holds a boolean, you can use it without any extra operator. For example:

```js
const isTrue = true;
if (isTrue) {
    console.log("OK!"); // "OK!"
}
```

You could write:

```js
const isTrue = true;
if (isTrue === true) {
    console.log("OK!"); // "OK!"
}
```

But that would be **redundant**. You'd generate another new boolean where you already got one.

You can use the `!` operator to negate (**invert**) the value:

```js
const isTrue = true;
if (!isTrue) {
    // This code will NOT execute because isTrue is true but ! inverts it (in this check)
} else {
    // This would execute because !isTrue yields false => else block executes
}
```

Again, that would be similar to:
