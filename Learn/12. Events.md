- Event Propagation
- Drag & Drop

## Event Introduction

We can run code upon certain events. In browser-side, we use `addEventListener` method and in server-side (like NodeJs), we use `on` method.

- Browser-side: `addEventListener('...', event => ...)`
- Server-side: `on('...', event => ...)`

It's important to understand that we have different kinds of events we can listen to. **a click on a button or a click on anything else, a right click or a double click, hovering over something or moving the mouse button away from something**; these are all different kinds of events.

**Note**: Events typically transport data.

We have an `Event` constructor function, a core event object you could say with some core functionalities which all events share.

You learned how you can add an event listener to a button. You first of all select the button, for example with `querySelector()` or with `getElementById()` and then you can use the `addEventListener` method which exists on any DOM node basically to attach an event to it.

Let's show you two other ways of adding events.

> **One** is a way that is pretty old and which you shouldn't use anymore, still for completeness sake, we want to show it to you.

You can go right to the HTML node in your HTML code and there, you can add an attribute. For example, `onclick`:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!');">Click on me</button>
```

This is not an arbitrary name chosen by us. There are various `on` attributes for different events that this element supports. So, if we click on that button, the output result will be `"Hello!"` (in `alert()` method (function)).

**Warning**: Don't mix HTML and HTML attributes and **JavaScript** code, it's absolutely not a recommended practice. You should register events in your **JavaScript** file instead.

> **Two**, we also have another way of adding an event. It's pretty close to what we did here in HTML. **Just this time in JavaScript**.

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.onclick = function () {
  alert("Hello!");
};
```

Or we can use arrow function for this way, for example:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  alert("Hello!");
};

button.onclick = clickButtonHandler;
```

**Note**: Don't execute this function right away, instead as with the event listener, point at it.

**Warning**: We can't use `button.onclick ..` twice. The reason for that is that we simply override the value which is stored in this property. So this (value or function) is not added or appended as a listener, it's simply overriding the old listener. For example:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  alert("Hello!");
};

const clickButtonHandler2 = () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
};

button.onclick = clickButtonHandler; // not works anymore
button.onclick = clickButtonHandler2; // this function will execute
```

Instead, it is recommended that you use `addEventListener` as we did it throughout this course, because this allows you to add multiple event listeners to the same element and you also have a `removeEventListener` function or method which you can use to remove an event listener.
