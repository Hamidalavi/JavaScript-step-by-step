## Learn about Objects

Objects are **core data structures in JavaScript**.

- Typically reflect **real-world** entities
  - e.g. button, movie.
  - Allow us to apply real-world logic to coding.
- Made up of properties & methods
  - Store data in properties and actions in methods.
  - Allow you to **group** related data together and split your code into logical pieces.

Well is in **JavaScript** you, must never forget that you have two types of values, **primitive values** and **reference values**, and in the end, reference values are object. So only objects are reference values.

|Primitive Values|Reference Values (= Objects)|
|:-:|:-:|
|Numbers|Everything else!|
|Strings|`{ .. }`|
|Booleans|Arrays|
|null|DOM Nodes|
|undefined|... other built-in objects|
|Symbol|-|
