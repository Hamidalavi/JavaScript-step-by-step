# Working with the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript

In this course, you learn about:

- HTML and DOM
- Nodes and Elements
- Querying DOM Nodes and Traversing the DOM
- Evaluating and Manipulating DOM Nodes
- Creating and Removing DOM Nodes

## `document` and `window`

You can access your **HTML** skeleton by `ducument`. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>DOM Interaction</title>
  <script src="app.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>


</body>
</html>
```

We can aslo use `console.dir(document)` for see `document`'s directory:

```js
console.dir(document);
```

Now we get access to real **JavaScript** object with all the properties that are in there and you see, there are a lot of properties in there.

`document` element here is basically our entire **HTML** content. So, the `body` gives us access to everything that was rendered in that body part, **HTML** holds everything that was rendered to set up for our entire HTML code which was rendered.

We also can type `window` here (console) and we get access to the window object. This is that real topmost object and this gives us access to all the core APIs that the browser wants to expose to us (like `alert()`, `prompt()`, `print()`, `blur()` and so on).

Actually browsers always parse our **JavaScript** code such that `window.` is automatically added in front of some function if that function can't be found anywhere else. So the browser always looks in the `window` object if we're calling or accessing something, which is like `alert()` would work here, so that's really great. For example:

```js
alert("Hey");
// or
window.alert("Hey");
```

## Small theory of `document` and `window`

**document**:

- Root DOM Node
- Provides access to element querying, DOM content etc.

**window**:

- The active Browser Window / Tab
- Acts as global storage for script, also provides access to window- specific properties and methods

## Element and Node

We can use in our HTML documents which are understood by the browser and which will be rendered to the screen. Browser renders all the pixels. For example, the `html` tag is translated to an `HTML` node.

Text node: The whitespaces in HTML file is also is **node**. Most whitespaces is actually not rendered but it is part of the that DOM tree. But of course, also the normal text is part of the DOM as **text node**. Text is indeed stored as objects but as a different kind of object, as a **text nodes** with different properties and different methods. So we have to type of node, 1. text node, 2. element node.

You can see your HTML elements in `developer tools` in browser, in **Elements** tab. You can also press `ctrl+shift+c` to use slecetion mode (or cursor icon in developer tools).

**Note**: `$0` always gives you access to the **last element you selected** in the `Elements` tab.

A Summary of describing `element` and `node`:

|Node|Element|
|:-:|:-:|
|The objects that make up the DOM|Special properties and methods to interact with the elements|
|HTML tags are **element nodes** (or just **elements**)|Available methods and properties depend on the kind of element|
|Text creates **text nodes**|Can be selected in various different ways (via **JavaScript**)|
|Attributes create **attribute nodes**|Can be created and removed via **JavaScript**|

**Note**: Elements are one type of nodes.

## Querying Elements

We have some different ways for querying elements, for example:

- `querySelector()`
- `querySelectorAll()`
- `getElementById()`
- `getElementByClassName()`
- `getElementByTagName()`
- and etc.

DOM nodes are just **JavaScript Object** in the end - i.e. **reference values**.These methods **return the object references (addresses)

> `querySelector()`, `getElementById()`

- Return single elements
- Differents ways of querying elements (by CSS selector, by ID)
- Direct reference to DOM elements is returned

> `querySelectorAll()`, `getElementByTagName()`, ...

- Returns collections of elements (array-like objects): NodeList
- Different ways of querying elements (by CSS selector, by tag name, by CSS class)
- `querySelectorAll()` returns a non-live NodeList, getXByY return live NodeLists

## Selecting Elements in the DOM

As you learned from the **Querying Elements** section, we want make some example:

For querying element id:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>DOM Interaction</title>
  <script src="app.js" defer></script>
</head>

<body>
  <header>
    <h1 id="main-title">Dive into the DOM!</h1>
  </header>
  <ul>
    <li class="list-item">list1</li>
    <li class="list-item">list2</li>
    <li class="list-item">list3</li>
  </ul>
  <script>
    document.getElementById(`main-title`); // gets this `h1` element
    document.getElementByClassName(`main-title`); // gets these `li` elements
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

If you want find the first matching items (elements) in class (and etc.), you use to use `querySelector()` for return to first matching item:

```js
document.querySelector('.list-item');
// <li class="list-item">list1</li>
```

If you have all matching items you use `document.querySelectorAll()` and then enter your CSS selector in there:

```js
document,querySelectorAll('.list-item');
// NodeList(3) [li.list-item, li.list-item, li.list-item]
// 0: li.list-item
// 1: li.list-item
// 2: li.list-item
// length: 3
// __proto__: NodeList
```

You can use different ways for `querySelector()`, for example:

```js
// find first element match
document.querySelectorAll('ul li:first-of-type');
// <li class="list-item">list1</li>

// find last element match
document.querySelectorAll('ul li:last-of-type');
// <li class="list-item">list3</li>
```

You can also store them into variable:

```js
const ul = document.querySelector('ul');
<li class="list-item">list1</li>
// <li class="list-item">list1</li>
```
