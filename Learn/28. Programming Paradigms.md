# Programming Paradigms

In this course, you will learn about:

- Programming Paradigms
- Procedural Programming
- Object Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming

## What are Programming Paradigms

It's just a way of writing code. It's about how we write and organize our code. It's not a syntax feature, it's not a special feature exposed by the browser or anything like this. It's really just how we structure our code and how we reason about our program we're writing. In the end, there are paradigms we could follow:

- Procedural
- OOP
- Functional

So what are they?

**Procedural**: When you're following a procedural style, and that's probably the style with which you got started when work with **JavaScript**, you simply write a sequential series of execution steps and tasks. So you have a top to buttom code execution. You always have that in every style, but here you list these different steps the engine in the end should execute and should perform, you don't organize your code in logical group or in logical pieces of data; you don't use objects and entities to structure your code; in the end, you just execute step after step.

**OOP**: If you're writing your code in an object oriented style, it means that you organize your data and logic in objects, or in classes and then in objects based on those classes; which means you store your data in properties of objects, you store your logic in methods of objects. Everything in your application (project) gets represented as a class and then in the end, as an object. So you organize your code in logical entities. You kind of try to translate the application you're writing into the real world and you think about your application and the things that make up your application in real world term. If you're building a shop application, you think about **products** and a **shopping cart** and so on. That's how you think about your code and how you organize it.

**Functional**: Then, we have functional programming and there, we organize our code in, if possible, pure functions with clearly defined tasks. You get all the data a function needs as parameters and then this function often also return something new. So you pass data around with parameters and your functions are your way of organizing your code. You have many functions, probably more than you have in the other styles and your functions hold your logic, every function if possible works on its own, and this is how you structure your code.

## Procedural Programming

Consider these HTML content and **JavaScript** script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Programming Paradigms</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css" />
  <script src="procedural.js" defer></script>
</head>

<body>
  <form id="user-input">
    <div class="form-control">
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" id="username" />
    </div>
    <div class="form-control">
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" id="password" />
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Create User</button>
  </form>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
const form = document.getElementById('user-input');

function signupHandler(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  const userNameInput = document.getElementById('username');
  const enteredUsername = userNameInput.value;

  const passwordInput = document.getElementById('password');
  const enteredPassword = passwordInput.value;

  if (enteredUsername.trim().length === 0) {
    alert('Invalid input - username must not be empty!');
    return;
  }
  if (enteredPassword.trim().length <= 5) {
    alert('Invalid input - password must be six characters or longer.');
    return;
  }

  const user = {
    userName: enteredUsername,
    password: enteredPassword
  };

  console.log(user);
  console.log(`Hi, I am ${user.userName}`);
}

form.addEventListener('submit', signupHandler);
```

This is a simple procedural programming style. execution by step after step.

## Object Oriented Programming

Consider these HTML content and **JavaScript** script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Programming Paradigms</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css" />
  <script src="oop.js" defer></script>
</head>

<body>
  <form id="user-input">
    <div class="form-control">
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" id="username" />
    </div>
    <div class="form-control">
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" id="password" />
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Create User</button>
  </form>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
class Validator {
  static REQUIRED = "REQUIRED";
  static MIN_LENGTH = "MIN_LENGTH";

  static validate(value, flag, validatorValue) {
    if (flag === this.REQUIRED) {
      return value.trim().length > 0;
    }
    if (flag === this.MIN_LENGTH) {
      return value.trim().length > validatorValue;
    }
  }
}

class User {
  constructor(uName, uPassword) {
    this.userName = uName;
    this.userPassword = uPassword;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi I am ${this.userName}`);
  }
}

class UserInputForm {
  constructor() {
    this.form = document.getElementById("user-input");
    this.userNameInput = document.getElementById("username");
    this.passwordInput = document.getElementById("password");

    this.form.addEventListener("submit", this.signupHandler.bind(this)); // refer to class
  }

  signupHandler(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const enteredUserName = this.userNameInput.value;
    const enteredPassword = this.passwordInput.value;

    if (
      !Validator.validate(enteredUserName, Validator.REQUIRED) ||
      !Validator.validate(enteredPassword, Validator.MIN_LENGTH, 5)
    ) {
      alert(
        "Invalid input - username and password is wrong (password should be at least six characters)."
      );
      return;
    }

    const newUser = new User(enteredUserName, enteredPassword);
    console.log(newUser);
    newUser.greet();
  }
}

new UserInputForm();
```

This is a simple OOP programming style. We think about our code as different objects working together and we split our code logically into entities, which can make it easier to reason about your code. We can also use the reusable code (instead of copy and pasting the code and use it in moment).

## Functional Programming

Consider these HTML content and **JavaScript** script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Programming Paradigms</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css" />
  <script src="functional.js" defer></script>
</head>

<body>
  <form id="user-input">
    <div class="form-control">
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" id="username" />
    </div>
    <div class="form-control">
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" id="password" />
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Create User</button>
  </form>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
const REQUIRED = "REQUIRED";
const MIN_LENGTH = "MIN_LENGTH";

function validate(value, flag, validatorValue) {
  if (flag === REQUIRED) {
    return value.trim().length > 0;
  }
  if (flag === MIN_LENGTH) {
    return value.trim().length > validatorValue;
  }
}

function getUserInput(inputElementId) {
  return document.getElementById(inputElementId).value;
}

function createUser(userName, userPassword) {
  if (!validate(userName, REQUIRED) || !validate(userPassword, MIN_LENGTH, 5)) {
    throw new Error(
      "Invalid input - username and password is wrong (password should be at least six characters)."
    );
  }
  return { userName: userName, password: userPassword };
}

function greetUser(user) {
  console.log(` Hi, I am ${user.userName}`);
}

function signupHandler(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  const enteredUserName = getUserInput("username");
  const enteredPassword = getUserInput("password");

  try {
    const newUser = createUser(enteredUserName, enteredPassword);
    console.log(newUser);
    greetUser(newUser);
  } catch (err) {
    alert(err.message);
  }
}

function connectForm(formId, formSubmitHandler) {
  const form = document.getElementById(formId);
  form.addEventListener("submit", formSubmitHandler);
}

connectForm("user-input", signupHandler);
```

This is a simple functional style. The core idea of course being that we organize our code into functions where most functions are pure and side-effect free and therefore, highly reusable.
