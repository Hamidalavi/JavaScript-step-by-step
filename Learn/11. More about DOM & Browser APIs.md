# More About DOM & Browser APIs

In this course, you learn about:

- Attaching Data to Elements
- Working with Element Coordinates & Sizes
- Working with Templates & Dynamic Scripts
- `navigator`, `location` & `window.history`

## `data-` Special Attribute and `dataset`

What is `data-`? How can we use them? We know that you hear it for first time. Consider:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>dataset</title>
  <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>
</head>

<body>

  <ul>
    <li id="prj1" data-extra-info="Got lifetime access!" class="none">
      <button class="alt">More Info</button>
    </li>
  </ul>

</body>

</html>
```

As you can see, we bring you a simple html content. In this content, you see `data-extra-info` attribute in `li` tag. We can access it from **JavaScript** with `element.dataset` property. We can set any kind of data to it, for example:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const li = document.getElementById("prj1");
dataset = () => {
  console.log(li.dataset);
};

btn.addEventListener("click", dataset);
/*
DOMStringMap {extraInfo: "Got lifetime access!"}
extraInfo: "Got lifetime access!"
__proto__: DOMStringMap
*/
```

We see the data that named `extraInfo`. **JavaScript** automatically convert `-` dash to camel-Case word.

**Note**: We can use whatever name we want for `data-` attributes, for example `data-whatever` or `data-hamid-alavi` and so on.

These `data-` attributes are (in HTML) all merged together in a `dataset` property.

We can also add this attribute in **JavaScript**, for example:

```js
const li = document.getElementById("prj1");

li.dataset.hamidAlavi = "My name";
/*
// HTML content
<li id="prj1" data-extra-info="Got lifetime access!" class="none" data-hamid-alavi="My name">
     <button class="alt">More Info</button>
</li>
*/
```

We added data with `element.dataset.dataName = "value"` (for example `li.dataset.hamidHamid = "My name";`).

We see the data that named `hamid-alavi`. **JavaScript** automatically add `-` add before UPPERCASE character and converts all words to lowercase.

## Getting Element Box Dimensions

We can get the element box dimensions by `$0.getBoundingClientRect()` method. As you learned before, `$0` is the last element which we selected in **Elements** tab in browser developer tools. Consider, we are selecting the button on any site:

1. First of all, we are going to browser developer tools.
2. Then we select an element (in **Elements** tab).
3. Finally we use this method.

```js
$0.getBoundingClientRect();
/*
DOMRect {x: 787.546875, y: 322.8125, width: 92.6875, height: 36, top: 322.8125, â€¦}
bottom: 358.8125
height: 36
left: 787.546875
right: 880.234375
top: 322.8125
width: 92.6875
x: 787.546875
y: 322.8125
__proto__: DOMRect
*/
```

You need to understand that the browser basically renders the page in a two-dimensional coordinate system with an x-axis from left to right and a y-axis from top to buttom.

**Important**: It's not like a traditional coordinate system where the y-axis would go from buttom to top and x from left to right at the buttom, but instead, it's all starting in the **top left corner**; and that make sense if you consider how a web page is rendered. It's rendered from **top to buttom**, not built up from buttom to top.

In top-left corner, we have `0, 0`x and y axis. Let's talk about `DOMRect` properties:

- **x y**: This basically means that this box (button) which we selected has its top left corner at a position of `322.8125` pixels down and `787.546875` pixels from the left.

- **left right top buttom**: They are exactly the same as x and y, but if we change the margin of that box in the CSS file (or set a negative value), it would be different value from these four directions.

- **width and height**: `width` gives us the total width of the box. `height` gives us the height of the box.
