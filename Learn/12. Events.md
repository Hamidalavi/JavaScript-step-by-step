# Events - Mouse Click, Hover and son on

In this course, you learn about:

- A Closer Look at Events
- Event Propagation
- Drag & Drop

## Event Introduction

We can run code upon certain events. In browser-side, we use `addEventListener` method and in server-side (like NodeJs), we use `on` method.

- Browser-side: `addEventListener('...', event => ...)`
- Server-side: `on('...', event => ...)`

It's important to understand that we have different kinds of events we can listen to. **a click on a button or a click on anything else, a right click or a double click, hovering over something or moving the mouse button away from something**; these are all different kinds of events.

**Note**: Events typically transport data.

We have an `Event` constructor function, a core event object you could say with some core functionalities which all events share.

You learned how you can add an event listener to a button. You first of all select the button, for example with `querySelector()` or with `getElementById()` and then you can use the `addEventListener` method which exists on any DOM node basically to attach an event to it.

Let's show you two other ways of adding events.

> **One** is a way that is pretty old and which you shouldn't use anymore, still for completeness sake, we want to show it to you.

You can go right to the HTML node in your HTML code and there, you can add an attribute. For example, `onclick`:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!');">Click on me</button>
```

This is not an arbitrary name chosen by us. There are various `on` attributes for different events that this element supports. So, if we click on that button, the output result will be `"Hello!"` (in `alert()` method (function)).

**Warning**: Don't mix HTML and HTML attributes and **JavaScript** code, it's absolutely not a recommended practice. You should register events in your **JavaScript** file instead.

> **Two**, we also have another way of adding an event. It's pretty close to what we did here in HTML. **Just this time in JavaScript**.

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.onclick = function () {
  alert("Hello!");
};
```

Or we can use arrow function for this way, for example:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  alert("Hello!");
};

button.onclick = clickButtonHandler;
```

**Note**: Don't execute this function right away, instead as with the event listener, point at it.

**Warning**: We can't use `button.onclick ..` twice. The reason for that is that we simply override the value which is stored in this property. So this (value or function) is not added or appended as a listener, it's simply overriding the old listener. For example:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  alert("Hello!");
};

const clickButtonHandler2 = () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
};

button.onclick = clickButtonHandler; // not works anymore
button.onclick = clickButtonHandler2; // this function will execute
```

Instead, it is recommended that you use `addEventListener` as we did it throughout this course, because this allows you to add multiple event listeners to the same element and you also have a `removeEventListener` function or method which you can use to remove an event listener. For example:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
};

button.addEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);
```

Now with the most elegant way of doing this. As we said, we can remove the event listener with `removeEventListener`. For example:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
};

button.addEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);

const removeClickEvent = () => {
  button.removeEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);
  console.log("Button event has removed!");
};

setTimeout(removeClickEvent, 3000);
```

- We get a button element
- We added the event listener for this element
- We set a timer (three seconds) for removing the event listener from button element

Consider:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("button");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Cicked!");
});

setTimeout(() => {
  button.removeEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Cicked!");
  });
}, 3000);
```

It's the same function, it does the exact same thing, right? If you test it on browser, you wil see no event listener removed. The reason for that simply is that, **these anonymous functions look similar to us humans, but technically it's not the same function object**. This `button.addEventListener("click", () => { ..` creates a new function object and so does the second `button.addEventListener("click", () => { ..`! **So these are two totally different object**.

Instead we have to make sure we store that anonymous function in a constant which then holds the address of this function object. For example:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
};

button.addEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);

setTimeout(() => {
  button.removeEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);
}, 3000);
```

Then, consider following example:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
};

button.addEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler.bind(this));

setTimeout(() => {
  button.removeEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler.bind(this));
}, 3000);
```

You might again think well this is similar, **no it isn't**. This is not similar, `bind(this)` creates a new function object and therefore we create a new function object of these event listeners, so this also will not work.

You will have to store the bound function in a new constant like `boundFn`. For example:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("button");

const clickButtonHandler = () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
};

const boundFn = clickButtonHandler.bind(this);

button.addEventListener("click", boundFn);

setTimeout(() => {
  button.removeEventListener("click", boundFn);
}, 3000);
```

That again we have the address of this function object. So we use the same function object and **this would work**. The other approach would not work.

## The `event` Object

Consider:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("button");

const clickButtonHandler = (event) => {
  console.log(event);
};

button.addEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);

setTimeout(() => {
  button.removeEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);
}, 3000);
/*

  which: 1
  x: 93
  y: 446
  __proto__: MouseEvent
*/
```

Every event has `target` property and `target` describes which target, which element in the end caused this event. So **where, in this case where you clicked on**.

Here is an event tree:

![evtree](https://o7planning.org/en/12321/images/37529913.png)

This `event` object is very very useful, for example:

```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

const clickButtonHandler = (event) => {
  event.target.disabled = true; // target: button
  console.log(event);
};

buttons.forEach((btn) => {
  btn.addEventListener("click", clickButtonHandler);
});
```

The buttons will be disabled when they're pressed. If we inspect these elements here, then we see they have the `disabled` attribute.

> We can also use `for..of` loop.

## Supported Event Types

We can also register other events, for example `mouseenter`. This event is (will) triggered whenever our mouse or a cursor enters any element.

```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

const clickButtonHandler = (event) => {
  event.target.disabled = true;
  console.log(event);
};

buttons.forEach((btn) => {
  btn.addEventListener("mouseenter", clickButtonHandler);
});
```

> Let's look at `relatedTarget` property, this can be useful. This can help you understand where the mouse cursor is coming from.
>> We can also use `for..of` loop.

Let's have fun with the `scroll` event and create a list which you can scroll infinitely:

```js
let curElementNumber = 0;

function scrollHandler() {
  const distanceToBottom = document.body.getBoundingClientRect().bottom;

  if (distanceToBottom < document.documentElement.clientHeight + 150) {
    const newDataElement = document.createElement("div");
    curElementNumber++;
    newDataElement.innerHTML = `<p>Element ${curElementNumber}</p>`;
    document.body.append(newDataElement);
  }
}

window.addEventListener("scroll", scrollHandler);
```

**Q**: What's happening here?

**Answer**:

- At the very bottom, we register the `scrollHandler` function as a handler for the `scroll` event on our `window` object.

- Inside that function, we first of all **measure the total distance** between our viewport (top left corner of what we currently see) and the end of the page (**not** just the end of our currently visible area) => Stored in `distanceToBottom`.

- For example, if our browser window has a height of `500px`, then `distanceToBottom` could be `684px`, assuming that we got some content we can scroll to.

- Next, we **compare the distance** to the bottom of our overall content (`distanceToBottom`) **to the window height + a certain threshold** (in this example `150px`). `document.documentElement.clientHeight` is preferable to `window.innerHeight` because it respects potential scroll bars.

- If we have **less than 150px to the end of our page content**, we make it into the if-block (where we append new data).

- Inside of the `if` statement, we then create a new `<div>` element and populate it with a `<p>` element which in turn outputs an incrementing counter value.

## `preventDefault()` Method

Consider:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("form");

button.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log(event);
});
/*
SubmitEvent {isTrusted: true, submitter: button#title, type: "submit", target: form, currentTarget: form, …}
  bubbles: true
  cancelBubble: false
  cancelable: true
  composed: false
  currentTarget: null
  defaultPrevented: true
  eventPhase: 0
  isTrusted: true
  path: (5) [form, body, html, document, Window]
  returnValue: false
  srcElement: form
  submitter: button#title
  target: form
  timeStamp: 2540.234999999484
  type: "submit"
  __proto__: SubmitEvent
*/
```

If we do this, the page will not reload (refresh) after submitting a value to sever (or client). Because by default, the page will reload when we submit a value.

**Note**: `preventDefault()` is a very important method on the `event` object, which you can use to control what the browser does with that event.

## Bubbling and Capturing

Let's say we have a button in a `<div>` which is in a `<section>`:

```html
<section>
  <div>
    <button></button>
  </div>
</section>
```

Consider that we click that button here. Now what actually happens is that the browser runs through two phases where it checks for listeners to that event.

**First**, it runs through a phase which is called the **capturing** phase. **Second**, it runs through a phase which is called the **bubbling** phase.

The **capturing** phase goes from outside to inside. Now what does this mean?

It's important to understand that a `click` event on such a nested `<button>` here, cannot just be listened to with event listeners on the `<button>`. But for example, also with an event listener on that `<section>` and the browser during the capturing phase checks if you got a capturing event listener on the `<section>` registered which would then actually run its function before any event listeners registered on the `<button>`. Because it's from outside to inside in the capturing phase, and the `<section>` is **outside of the `<button>`**.

The bubbling phase on the other hand does the opposite; it goes from inside to outside. All event listeners you add with `addEventListener` are by default registered in that bubbling phase; which means if we have an event listener on the `<button>` and on the `<section>`, **the `<button>` event listener will runs first, the `<section>` event listener will runs second**.

Let's expand this article with an example:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<section>
  <div>
    <button>Click me!</button>
  </div>
</section>
```

```js
// JavaScript
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const div = document.querySelector("div");

div.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("CLICKED DIV");
});

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("CLICKED BUTTON");
});
/*
CLICKED BUTTON
CLICKED DIV
*/
```

Now with that setup, if you click on the button here, you see both execute `button` and then `div`. So it executes from inside to outside, because as we mentioned, by default all event listeners are registered in the bubbling phase; which means that capturing phase which runs first is totally ignored.

We can switch to the capturing phase by adding an extra third argument on the `addEventListener` (event listeners). The default value is `false`, we can switch it to `true` in the third argument of event listeners. For example:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const div = document.querySelector("div");

div.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("CLICKED DIV");
}, true);

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("CLICKED BUTTON");
});
/*
CLICKED DIV
CLICKED BUTTON
*/
```

Let's say we do have an event listener on the `div` element. But we only want to react to clicks on the `div` here, not to clicks on a `button` in the `div`.

If we want to make sure that `button` clicks don't trigger the `div` click listener, for example `button` doesn't propagate anymore, we can call `event.stopPropagation()`.

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const div = document.querySelector("div");

div.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("CLICKED DIV");
});

button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  console.log("CLICKED BUTTON");
});
```

That's not the same as `preventDefault()` method.

We also have `event.stopImmediatePropagation()`, this is useful if we have multiple event listeners on the same element. So if we had more event listeners on the `button`, then after the **first event listener**, the other `button` listeners (the other listeners on the same element) wouldn't run anymore.

With just `stopPropagation()`, all `button` event listeners would execute and only ancestor element click listeners would not execute. That the difference here.

## Event Delegation Pattern

Consider this following html content and **JavaScript** code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Events!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/events.css" />
  <script src="assets/scripts/events.js" defer></script>
  <style>
    li {
      padding: 1rem;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }

    ul {
      list-style: none;
    }

    .bg-red {
      background-color: red;
      color: white;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <ul>
    <li>item 1</li>
    <li>item 2</li>
    <li>item 3</li>
    <li>item 4</li>
    <li>item 5</li>
  </ul>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");
for (const li of listItems) {
  li.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    // li.classList.toggle("bg-red");
    event.target.classList.toggle("bg-red");
  });
}
```

We should be able to click them and toogle our colors here (in browser). But it's pretty cumbersome to add multiple listeners; additionally, it can get bad from a performance and memory perspective. Because we got a lot of event listeners out there.

Let's have a look at the alternative which uses this **delegate pattern**. Instead of adding multiple listeners on each list item, we select the `<ul>`; the list that holds the list items.

```js
const list = document.querySelector("ul");

list.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  {
    // li.classList.toggle("bg-red");
    event.target.classList.toggle("bg-red");
    console.log(event);
  }
});
```

We still want to use the `event.target.classList.toggle("bg-red");`. Because if our listener is registered on the `list`, `event.target` will refer to the actual target on which we clicked (i.e our list item).

Now with only one event listener instead of multiple event listeners, because we're taking advantage of event propagation and then we're adding a listener on the next higher element which in this case is the `list` instead of every child element itself. This is the **event delegation pattern**.

**Warning**: This event delegation pattern can become problematic if we have a more complex structure. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Events!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/events.css" />
  <script src="assets/scripts/events.js" defer></script>
  <style>
    li {
      padding: 1rem;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }

    ul {
      list-style: none;
    }

    .bg-red {
      background-color: red;
      color: white;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 1</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 2</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 3</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 4</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 5</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</body>

</html>
```

We have an problem here, if we click on the title (i.e `<h2>`), we (you) see this gets the red background, not the entire element. Because we were refering to `event.target`. We have a problem, because `event.target` is the actual DOM element on which we clicked and that's the lowest possible element.

So just coloring or using `event.target` is not helping us here. We can use `console.log(event.currentTarget)` to see the current target (here example is `<ul>...</ul>`). So `event.currentTarget` always refers to the `list` (`<ul>`) element, because that's where we register our listener. So that can also be usfeful sometimes, but here it isn't (it's just a `list` which is not what we need).

Now as you learned about the DOM traversal, a specific method that can help us here and that would be on `event.target` which is some DOM object inside of our `list`, because we have just the list and the list items. Hence it's either the `<h2>` tag, the `<p>` or the `<li>` itself.

That method is `closest()`. This method exists on all DOM objects and it traverses up in the ancestor tree. For example:

```js
const list = document.querySelector("ul");

list.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  {
    event.target.closest("li").classList.toggle("bg-red");
    console.log(event);
  }
});
```

We can select the closest element with a certain CSS selector (we refer to the `closest()` method). We could select id `id`, by `class` or just by `<tag>`.

So this is now the **perfect event delegation pattern**, because we delegate our event and we still make sure we worked with the right element. **With a combination of `event.target` and DOM traversal.

## Triggering DOM Elements Programmatically

Sometimes, we don't want to listen to an event or at least not just listen to an event; we might want to trigger an event programmatically.

For example, when we click any list item (we refer to the `event.target.closest("li")`) for whatever reason, we want to trigger a **click** event on our `button`. A better example might be with our `form` by the way. There we could say we want to submit the `form`, not just with the **submit button** in there, but (also) when something else happens on the page.

so, when we click any list item (we refer to the `event.target.closest("li")`) for whatever reason, we want to submit this `form`. Consider:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Events!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/events.css" />
  <script src="assets/scripts/events.js" defer></script>
  <style>
    li {
      padding: 1rem;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }

    ul {
      list-style: none;
    }

    .bg-red {
      background-color: red;
      color: white;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <form action="">
    <label for="title">Title</label>
    <input type="text" id="title">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 1</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 2</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 3</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 4</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Item 5</h2>
      <p>Hello</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</body>

</html>
```

Now to do that, we need access to that `form` element for which we want to trigger an event. To do that, we must do:

```js
const form = document.querySelector("form");
const button = document.querySelector("button");

form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log(event);
});

button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  console.log("CLICKED BUTTON");
  console.log(event);
});

const list = document.querySelector("ul");

list.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.target.closest("li").classList.toggle("bg-red");
  form.submit();
  // form.click();
});
```

Now we want to call `form` and now we can call `click()` there for example to simulate a mouse click on it or also submit.

**Note**: We also have a `form.submit()`. This does not just exists for the `form`, but basically for any DOM element. A lot of events we can also listen to trigger programmatically.

If we click on any list item, the page will reload; because the `form` was submitted. Now you might be wondering why our event listener (for `form` submission) **is not doing its work and preventing the default**. If you trigger a submit event programmatically, then indeed the submit event listener will skip; typically event listeners execute.

Now if we use the `button.click()`, it would be works.

```js
list.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.target.closest("li").classList.toggle("bg-red");
  button.click();
});
```

> For form submittion, the event listener will not trigger. So triggering such a event programmatically is not exactly the same as when a user clicks on it. It can bypass certain listeners like a **form submittion** listener.

## `this` Keyword in Events

As you know, when we use arrow function in event listeners, when we do `console.log(this);`, we will see that we will get the `window` object there. Because as we said, we're using an arrow function and that ignores any binding we might have assigned to `this` when that function gets called.

```js
button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  console.log("CLICKED BUTTON");
  console.log(this); // `window` object
});
```

Let's convert this here into a regular function:

```js
button.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  console.log("CLICKED BUTTON");
  console.log(this); // <button>Click me</button>
});
```

Now we see `this` points at the `button` here. In the end, `this` points at the event target (it refers to the `event.target`). To be precise as we can show you here on our list event listener here; first of all we copy and paste the code here with some modifications:

```js
const list = document.querySelector("ul");

list.addEventListener("click", function(event)  {
  event.target.closest("li").classList.toggle("bg-red");
  // form.submit();
  button.click();
  console.log(this); // <ul>...</ul>
  console.log(event.currentTarget); // <ul>...</ul>
```

As you can see, it points at the current target (it refers to the `event.currentTarget`), not at the concrete target we clicked on; but **at the current target**. So basically at the element on which we registered the event listener.

## Drag and Drop Theory

To make elements draggable, we have to mark them as such and we do that by adding the `draggable` attribute or setting the `draggable` property on the DOM elements to `true` (default is `false`). So both needs to be set to `true`, either the attribute or directly through the property. For example:

```html
<button type="submit" draggable="true">Submit</button>
```

or

```js
button.draggable = true;
```

The next step then is to listen to a `dragstart` event on the element which is draggable, this will be triggered whenever a user starts dragging the event.

Drag and drop operation is actually a comination of different events, on different elements on your page.

The third step is we add a listener to the `dragenter` and the `dragover` events. We can omit the `dragenter` event, we definetly need the `dragover` event. Both will be triggered whenever an item is dragged onto that element. The difference between the two elements is that:

- `dragover` basically triggers for child elements of the element where we added it.
- `dragenter` won't trigger there.

**Note**: You have to call `preventDefault()`, because the default is always that a drop operation is (be) cancel.

We can also (forth) optionally listen to a `dragleave` event if we want to update the UI for example, update some styles when the item is drag (dragged) away from the element on which it was dragged over.

The next step is that we can listen to the `drop` event on the same element where we listened to `dragenter` and `dragover` events. The `drop` event will only be triggered if we prevented to default in `dragenter` and `dragover` events and the item is then dropped onto that same element.

Indeed, when we make an element draggable, we'll get some visual feedback that looks like the user is really dragging the element. But it's actually not getting moved in the DOM technically.

And finally, we also optionally can then listen to a `dragend` event; not on the place where it was dropped, but on the dragged element itself and there we could also then update the UI or some data. The `dragend` event is always fired even if the `drop` is cancel.

Let's repeat all steps in one line:

- Mark elements as `draggable`.
- Listen to `dragstart` event -- describe operation and append data.
- Accept drop via `dragenter` and `dragover` events => `preventDefault()`.
- Optional: Listen to `dragleave` event -- e.g. update styles.
- Listen to `drop` event and update data / UI.
- Optional: Listen to `dragend` event and update data / UI.

## Drag Types

The HTML Drag and Drop API supports dragging various types of data, including **plain text**, **URLs**, **HTML code**, **files**, etc.

> Dragging Text

```js
event.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", "This is text to drag");
```

Dragging text in textboxes and selections on web pages is done automatically by the browser, so you do not need to handle it yourself.

It is recommended to always add data of the `text/plain` type as a fallback for applications or drop targets that do not support other types, unless there is no logical text alternative.

**Note**: In older code, you may find `text/unicode` or the `Text` types. These are equivalent to `text/plain`, and will store and retrieve plain text data.

> Dragging Links

Dragged hyperlinks should include data of two types: `text/uri-list`, and `text/plain`. Both types should use the link’s URL for their data. For example:

```js
let dt = event.dataTransfer;
dt.setData("text/uri-list", "https://www.google.com");
dt.setData("text/plain", "https://www.google.com");
```

As usual, set the `text/plain` type last, as a fallback for the `text/uri-list` type.

**Note**: the URL type is `uri-list` **with an I, not an L**.

> Dragging HTML and XML

HTML content may use the `text/html` type. The data for this type should be serialized HTML source code. For example, it would be suitable to set its data to the value of the `innerHTML` property of an element.

XML content may use the `text/xml` type, but ensure that the data is well-formed XML.

You may also include a plain text representation of the HTML or XML data using the `text/plain` type. The data should be just the text without any of the source tags or attributes. For instance:

```js
let dt = event.dataTransfer;
dt.setData("text/html", "Hello there, <strong>stranger</strong>");
dt.setData("text/plain", "Hello there, stranger");
```

> Dragging Files

Let's describe the rest types in other courses. You would be confuse.

## DataTransfer.effectAllowed

The `event.DataTransfer.effectAllowed` property specifies the effect that is allowed for a drag operation. The `copy` operation is used to indicate that the data being dragged will be copied from its present location to the drop location. The `move` operation is used to indicate that the data being dragged will be moved, and the `link` operation is used to indicate that some form of relationship or connection will be created between the source and drop locations.

This property should be set in the `dragstart` event to set the desired drag effect for the drag source. Within the `dragenter` and `dragover` event handlers, this property will be set to whatever value was assigned during the `dragstart` event, thus `effectAllowed` may be used to determine which effect is permitted.

**Note**: Assigning a value to `effectAllowed` in events other than `dragstart` has no effect.

A `DOMString` representing the drag operation that is allowed. The possible values are:

- `none`: The item may not be dropped.
- `copy`: A copy of the source item may be made at the new location.
- `copyLink`: A copy or link operation is permitted.
- `copyMove`: A copy or move operation is permitted.
- `link`: A link may be established to the source at the new location.
- `linkMove`: A link or move operation is permitted.
- `move`: An item may be moved to a new location.
- `all`: All operations are permitted.
- `uninitialized`: The default value when the effect has not been set, equivalent to all.

**Note1**: Assigning any other value to `effectAllowed` has no effect and the old value is retained.

**Note2**: Internet Explorer will change the value to be lowercased; thus, `linkMove` will become `linkmove`, and so on.

## Working with Drag and Drop

Consider this following html content and **JavaScript** code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Project Board</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/app.css" />
  <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>
  <style>
    .bagrnd {
      background-color: green;
      color: white;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li id="p" draggable="true">
        <h2>Hello World 2</h2>
        <p>Finish the course within the next three weeks.</p>
        <button>Finish</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
class ListItem {
  constructor() {
    this.drag();
    this.drop();
  }

  drag() {
    document.getElementById("p").addEventListener("dragstart", (event) => {
      event.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", "Test");
      event.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = "move";
    });
  }

  drop() {
    const list = document.querySelector(`ul`);
    list.addEventListener("dragenter", (event) => {
      if (event.dataTransfer.types[0] === "text/plain") {
        list.parentElement.classList.add("bagrnd");
        event.preventDefault();
      }
    });

    list.addEventListener("dragover", (event) => {
      if (event.dataTransfer.types[0] === "text/plain") {
        event.preventDefault();
      }
    });

    list.addEventListener("dragleave", function (event) {
      if (event.relatedTarget.closest(`ul`) !== this) { // this = list
        list.parentElement.classList.remove("bagrnd");
      }
    });
  }
}

new ListItem();
```

This is a good practice for you to using the **drag** events. You must practice by your own to fully understand this pattern.
