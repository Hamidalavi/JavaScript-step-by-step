# Basics of JavaScript

If you want create a **JavaScript** file, create a file with `js` extension. Because it hold **JavaScript** code.

There are two methods to interact HTML files with **JavaScript** files.

- Puting your code between `script` tag. For example:

    ```html
    <script>alert("Hello!");</script>
    ```

- Use `src` attribute from `script` tag to reference it into any **JavaScript** file. For example:

    ```html
    <script src="basic.js"></script>
    ```

**Warning**: Always put `script` tags in end of `body` tag in `HTML` file. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>

    <script src="basic.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Note**: You sould import all dependencies files for a file before using it. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
</head>

<body>

  <script src="path/app_dependencies_1.js"></script>
  <script src="path/app_dependencies_2.js"></script>
  <script src="path/file.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

## Variable and Constant

You can delare a variable with `let` or `var` keyword. Also you can delare a constant with `const` keyword.

As you undestood at **JavaScript-tips** file (repository), variables can be change anytime. But constant's values cannot be change. For example:

```js
let name = "Hamid";
const value = 10;

name = "Hamed";
value = 13; // Error -- constant's values can't change
```

**JavaScript** has typed values, not typed variables. Only values have type in **JavaScript**; variables are just simple containers for those values.

There is a huge confusing of many developers:

```js
variable and value
const constant = 0;
let hamid = constant;
hamid = 23;
console.log(hamid); // 23
```

As you can see, hamid's value is `23`. Because `hamid` just get `constant`'s value. `hamid` dont't convert `const`. Thinking about it abit.

## Allow and Disallow in Variable Declaration

|Allow|Disallow / Not Recommended|
|:-:|:-:|
|let userName|let user_name|
|let hamid235|let 23hamid|
|let $kindOfSpecial|let user-b|
|let _internalValue|let let|

> In Allow list, here some reason:

- Best Practice for using **camelCase**.

- compound letters and digits is good idea (like let hamid23;).

- You can starting with `$` for variables.

- You can starting with `_` for variables.

> In Disallow / Not Recommended list, here some reason:

- `let hamid_alavi` is allowed but bad practice!

- Starting digits not allowed.

- Don't use special characters!

- You can't use primary keywords for variables (like `let var;`)

## Basic Operators

|Operator|Description|Category|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`=`|Assign value to variable|Assignment|
|`+`|Add two numbers|Math|
|`-`|Subtract two numbers|Math|
|`*`|Multiply two numbers|Math|
|`/`|Divide two numbers|Math|
|`%`|Divide two numbers, yield remainder|Math|
|`**`|Exponentiation|Math|

For example:

```js
let add = 2 + 2; // 4
let minus = 2 - 2; // 0
let mul = 2 * 3; // 6
```

## Basic Data Types

|Data Type|Example|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Number|`23`, `-34`, `3.14`|Important for calculation|
|String (text)|`'hi'`, `"hi"`, `` `hi` ``|Important for outputing result, gathering input|

## String

**JavaScript** have three types of string:

> ### Single quotes

```js
let hamid = 'Hello, I am single quotes';
console.log(hamid); // "Hello, I am single quotes"
```

> ### Double quotes

```js
let hamed = "Hello, I'm double quotes";
console.log(hamed); // "Hello, I'm double quotes"
```

> ### template literal

```js
let ali = `Hello, I'm backticks`;
console.log(ali); // "Hello, I'm backticks"

let lt = "template literal";
let reza = `Hello, I'm ${lt}`;
console.log(reza); // "Hello, I'm template literal"
```

**Warning**: You can't use multiple single quotes (`'`); because it's not valid in **JavaScript**. For example, `let hamed = 'Hello, I'm single quotes';` not valid, because output is `Hello I` and rest of text will ignore. So we recommend to using **double quote** or `backtick`.

We call the `` ` `` text, **template literal**. If you search that in **search engines**, you find out some examples of that.

`${ .. }` is for values, that make a dynamic string. For example, `reza` get `lt`'s value and showing in output.

Template literals also can be multiline and using indent. For example:

```js
let majid = ` Hello, I'm also
                can be multiline and indention.

it's great for everyone :)`;
console.log(majid);
/*"  Hello, I'm also
                can be multiline and indention.

it's great for everyone :)" */
```

You can do that with normal strings by `\n` scape notation. For example:

```js
let majid = " Hello, I'm also\n can be multiline. it's\n\n great for everyone :)"
console.log(majid);
/**" Hello, I'm also
 can be multiline. it's

 great for everyone :)" */
```

But indent will not shown in oputput. Console will ignore whitespaces. For more information about scape notation, read [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Escape_notation) link.

## Functions Definition

Two ways will happening:

> ### Define a function

It means that if you don't want use some code repeatly, you can define a `function` and use that functions everywhere. For define a function, you need write `function` keyword, then put anything you want (for function name). After that, write `()` for function's **parameter**(s). You can (but don’t have to) use parameters (e.g. name) and you can (but don’t have to) return values (via `return`). Then write your code between `{ .. }` curly braces (function body).

> ### Execute a function

After defining a function, you must execute it with `()`. For example:

```js
function hamid() {
    console.log("Call me!");
}

hamid(); // "Call me!"
```

**Warning**: Don't put `;` semicolon after function definition.

In functions. **Whitespace**, **line breaks** and **indentation** are all totally optional! Not required (we don't point to normal string)!

Here is a funcrion with two parameters:

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
    console.log(num1 + num2);
}

add(15,8); // 23
```

At above snippet, we pass `argument`s on `add` function. First argument is `15` and second one is `8`.
