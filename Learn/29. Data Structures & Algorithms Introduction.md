# Data Structures & Algorithms Introduction

In this course, you will learn about: Time Complexity & Big O Notation

**What are data structure and algorithm**: The data structure is something like an array or an object, or also maps and sets. The algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem. For example:

```js
const array = [3, 1, 2];
```

This array is a data structure, because that is built into **JavaScript** and built into most programming languages actually. It's a piece of data which also follows certain rules; in the case of an array, an ordered list of data where every item has an index, and we can work with that data structure to solve a certain problem.

**Why you should care about data structure and algorithm**:

- More complex programs may require more sophisticated data storage solutions and computation.
- In addition, you must be able to think logically as a programmer - get a **problem solving** attribute.

Example of algorithm:

```js
function getMin(numbers) {
  if (!numbers.length) {
    throw new Error("Should not be an empty array!");
  }
  let currentMinimum = numbers[0]; // access to first element

  /*
    `let i = 1;` because we defined `currentMinimum` to `0` index value,
    and we want start at second index (i.e. numbers[1])
  */
  for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] < currentMinimum) {
      currentMinimum = numbers[i];
    }
    return currentMinimum;
  }
}

const testNumbers = [3, 1, 2];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // 1
```

Another example:

```js
const testNumbers = [100, -5, -2];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // -5
```

Still another example:

```js
const testNumbers = [1, 5, 1];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // 1
```

We can use another logic for doing this (sorting elements):

```js
function getMin(numbers) {
  if (!numbers.length) {
    throw new Error("Should not be an empty array!");
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    let outerElement = numbers[i];
    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      let innerElement = numbers[j];

      if (outerElement > innerElement) {
        // swap elements
        numbers[i] = innerElement;
        numbers[j] = outerElement;

        outerElement = numbers[i];
        innerElement = numbers[j];
      }
    }
  }
  return numbers[0];
}

const testNumbers = [3, 1, 2];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // 3
```

Another example:

```js
const testNumbers = [2, 1, -5, 10, 10, -10];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // -10
```

Still another example:

```js
const testNumbers = [1, 1, 1, 5];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // 1
```

The, still another example:

```js
const testNumbers = [5, 1, 5];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // 1
```

## Some Algorithms

How do we compare different algorithm?

We use something which is called **time complexity**. Consider:

```js
function getMin(numbers) { // [3, 1, 2]
  if (!numbers.length) { // 1 execution
    throw new Error("Should not be an empty array!");
  }
  let currentMinimum = numbers[0]; // access to first element - 1 execution
  console.log("EXECUTION - INIT"); // "EXECUTION - INIT"

  for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) { // 1 execution
    console.log("EXECUTION - FOR"); // 2x "EXECUTION - FOR"
    if (numbers[i] < currentMinimum) { // 2 executions
      currentMinimum = numbers[i]; // 1 execution
    }
    console.log("EXECUTION - RETURN"); // "EXECUTION - RETURN"
    return currentMinimum; // 1 execution
  }
}

const testNumbers = [3, 1, 2];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // 1

// T = n => Linear Time Complexity => O(n)
```

Then we compare this code to:

```js
function getMin(numbers) {
  if (!numbers.length) {
    throw new Error("Should not be an empty array!");
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    let outerElement = numbers[i]; // n times
    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      let innerElement = numbers[j]; // n times

      if (outerElement > innerElement) {
        // swap elements
        numbers[i] = innerElement;
        numbers[j] = outerElement;

        outerElement = numbers[i];
        innerElement = numbers[j];
      }
    }
  }
  return numbers[0];
}

const testNumbers = [3, 1, 2];

const min = getMin(testNumbers);
console.log(min); // 1

// Quadratic Time Complexity = n * 2 => O(n^2)
```

And we see that the first code is better that the second code.

Let's try another example about even and odd:

```js
function evenOrOdd(number) {
  const result = number % 2;
  if (result === 0) {
    return "Even";
  } else {
    return "Odd";
  }
}

console.log(evenOrOdd(10)); // "Even"
console.log(evenOrOdd(11)); // "Odd"
```

We can also use ternary operator for this example:

```js
function evenOrOdd(number) {
  return number % 2 ? "Odd" : "Even";
}

console.log(evenOrOdd(10)); // "Even"
console.log(evenOrOdd(11)); // "Odd"
```

Still another example about sum up:

```js
function sumUp(numbers) {
  let sum = 0; // 1 execution

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  return sum; // 1 execution
}

// Linear Time Complexity => O(n)

const array = [1, 14, 8];

console.log(sumUp(array));
```

- Now we learned about **linear time complexity**, expressed with `O(n)`. For example `sumUp()` which we just created, this here will take a linear amount of time; the more items we feed in, the longer it takes, but it grows in a linear fashion. For example, `10000` items take `10000` times longer than a single item:

  ![Big-O-Notation](https://lukasmestan.com/assets/images/o-n.png)

- We also learned about quadratic time complexity where this would not be the case. We express it with `O(n^2)` and here for example we could write own `sort` algorithm which basically uses the sorting logic we wrote a little bit earlier in this section; where we have nested `for` loops; if we have a `for` loop in a `for` loop, we typically have **quadratic time complexity**. So that means the more items we have, the longer it takes, but i grows exponentially. So it's not growing in a linear way, but instead at the faster rate.

  ![Big-O-Notation](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENYGnFtXsAIb6pb.png)

- If we push an item onto an array, we append a new item at the end, other items are not affected by this, and therefore this also would have a **constant time complexity**, expressed with `O(1)`. No matter how many items are in the array in this example here:

  ```js
  const array = [1, 2, 3];
  array.push(5);
  ```

  This operation will always take equally long and it was the same for our `evenOrOdd()` function, no matter which number we checked. The operation time was always the same.

- Now there also is another complexity which we haven't seen thus far, and that would be **logarithmic time complexity**, expressed with `O(log n)`; and here for example that would be a so-called **binary search algorithm** which we could implement. There essentially what happens in that the more items we have, the longer it takes, but it does grow at a slow rate, slower that **linear time complexity** for example; so for a million items, we don't take a million times longer than for a single item:

  ```js
  const array = [1, 2, 3];
  const element = binSearch(array, 2);
  ```

## Data Structure

Consider:

```js
const age = [23, 29, 30];

// [23, 29, 30] => [23, 29, 30, _]
// [0, 1, 2] => [0, 1, 2, 3]
age.push(60); // => Constant Time Complexity: O(1)

// [23, 29, 30] => [_, 23, 29, 30]
// [0, 1, 2] => [0, 1, 2, 3]
age.unshift(10); // => Linear Time Complexity: O(n)

const myAge = age[0]; // => Constant Time Complexity: O(1)

// ---

const namePopularity = [
  { username: "Hamid", usages: 5 },
  { usename: "Hamed", usages: 3 }
];

const hamedUsages = namePopularity.find((pers) => pers.usename === "Hamed")
  .usages;
// BEST CASE: Constant Time Complexity => O(1)
// WORST CASE: Linear Time Complexity => O(n)
// AVERAGE CASE: Linear Time Complexity => O(n)

const nameMap = { Hamid: 5, Hamed: 3 };

const hamedUsages2 = nameMap["Hamed"]; // Constant Time Complexity => O(1)
```

As we mentioned, array is a data structure and we compare some ways for the best performance perspective. This is very useful for interviews.
