# Objects

In this course, you learn about: Closer Look at Objects.

## Learn about Objects

Objects are **core data structures in JavaScript**.

- Typically reflect **real-world** entities
  - e.g. button, movie.
  - Allow us to apply real-world logic to coding.
- Made up of properties & methods
  - Store data in properties and actions in methods.
  - Allow you to **group** related data together and split your code into logical pieces.

Well is in **JavaScript** you must never forget that you have two types of values, **primitive values** and **reference values**, and in the end, reference values are object. So only objects are reference values.

|Primitive Values|Reference Values (= Objects)|
|:-:|:-:|
|Numbers|Everything else!|
|Strings|`{ .. }`|
|Booleans|Arrays|
|null|DOM Nodes|
|undefined|... other built-in objects|
|Symbol|-|

Objects are **reference values** - you learned that.

It might not have been obvious yet but it's also important to recognize that, in the end, **objects are of course made up of primitive values**. Here's an example:

```js
const complexPerson = {
  name: "Hamid",
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  address: {
    street: "Some Street",
    stateId: 10,
    country: "Iran",
    phone: {
      number: Number("+989216570293"),
      isMobile: true,
    },
  },
};
```

Event though `complexPerson` has multiple nested reference values (nested arrays and objects), you end up with primitive values if you drill into the object.

- `name` holds a string (`"Hamid"`) => Primitive value.

- `hobbies` holds an array (i.e. a reference value) which is full of strings (`"Programming"`, `"Gaming"`) => Primitive values.

- `address` holds an object which in turn holds a mixture of primitive values like `"Some Street"` and nested objects (`phone`), but if you dive into `phone`, you find only numbers and booleans in there => Primitive values.

So you could say: **Primitive values are the core building blocks that hold your data**, **objects (and arrays) are helpful for organizing and working with that data**.

If we created an object, we can enter a `.` dot notation and now we have access to all the properties and methods that are stored on this object:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};

console.log(person.name); // "Hamid"
```

If we access a property on an object which doesn't exist, we're not getting error; instead, we get `undefined`:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};

console.log(person.name); // "Hamid"
console.log(person.isAdmin); // undefined
```

We can simply assign a value to this property now. Even if we didn't define it before:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};

console.log(person.name); // "Hamid"

person.isAdmin = true;
console.log(person.isAdmin); // true
```

We can modify object properties by `.` dot notation. For example:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};

console.log(person.name); // "Hamid"

person.name = "Reza";
console.log(person.name); // "Reza"
```

If we want to delete a property (one way of getting rid of a property), there is a `delete` keyword for doing that:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};

delete person.name;
console.log(person.name); // undefined
```

**Note**: If we want to try to access `name`, it will not get an error, will just get `undefined`.

Therefore another way of getting rid of a property is to use `person.name = undefined`. Keep in mind that you should actually never assign `undefined` to any value.

## Special Key Names

We can use any `string` as a key in an object and actually any key we enter is automatically coerced, which is this behind the scenes automatic convertion to us could say, to a string. So even `name` is kind of converted to a string in **JavaScript**. Consider:

```js
const person = {
  first-name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};
// SyntaxError: Unexpected token '-'
```

Now therefore for names like this (`first-name`), we have to tell **JavaScript** that: No no no, we want to use this as a key, it's not some calculation which you should perform or anything like that, it should just be a key name.

**Q**: And how could we tell **JavaScript** that this should be a key name which in the end is just a string?

**Answer**: Well we just wrap it in quotes; single or double quotes, doesn't matter, either way works. So we can just use any `string` here as a key name, with a `-` dash, with a whitespace, with multiple words, whatever we want, these are all valid key names.

```js
const person = {
  "first-name": "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};
```

**Warning**: You can't use this way on declaring a variable or constant, for example `const 'first-name' = ...`. This is really exclusive to objects.

**Q**: Now how can we access the `first-name` key? Can we use the `person.first-name` or `person.'first-name'`?

**Answer**: **JavaScript** tries to parse this as an expression and in **JavaScript**, this is never a valid syntax. But other than that, we have this `[]` square bracket notation available on any object.

```js
const person = {
  "first-name": "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};

console.log(person["first-name"]); // "Hamid"
```

We can also use thism `[]` square bracket notation in DOM, for example:

```js
const movieList = document.getElementById("movie-list");
movieList.style.backgroundColor = "red";
movieList.style[backgroundColor] = "red";
movieList.style['backgroundColor'] = "red";
movieList.style["backgroundColor"] = "red";
movieList.style["background-color"] = "red";
// these are the same
```

It shows the power of this `[]` square bracket; and just again, because it's important, all non-string keys in objects are kind of automatically converted to `strings`, coerced to strings by **JavaScript**.

```js
// these keys will coerced to string by JavaScript
const person = {
  "first-name": "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
  greet: function () {
    alert("Hi there!");
  },
};
```

## Property Types and Property Order

As you know, arrays are objects with number keys where the **order should be guaranteed (ascending)**. Objects can also use numbers as a key, for example:

```js
const object = {
  1: "Hamid",
  6: "Reza",
  3: "Ali",
};

console.log(object); // { '1': 'Hamid', '3': 'Ali', '6': 'Reza' }
```

This is not including negative numbers though, so negative numbers are not allowed. Must be a positive number (zero or higher), for example:

```js
const object = {
  -1: "Hamid", // SyntaxError: Unexpected token '-'
  6: "Ali",
  -3: "Reza", // SyntaxError: Unexpected token '-'
};

console.log(object); // Error
```

We **can't** access the decimal number keys like this (by `.` dot notation):

```js
const object = {
  1.4: "Hamid",
  6: "Reza",
  3: "Ali",
};

console.log(object.1.4); // SyntaxError
```

`.` Dot notation would also **not** work for integer numbers:

```js
const object = {
  1.4: "Hamid",
  6: "Reza",
  3: "Ali",
};

console.log(object.6); // SyntaxError
```

We can access these keys by `[]` square bracket notation, then we don't have to wrap this in quotes:

```js
const object = {
  1.4: "Hamid",
  6: "Reza",
  3: "Ali",
};

console.log(object[1.4]); // "Hamid"
console.log(object[6]); // "Reza"
```

As we mentioned, we don't have to wrap this in quotes, because **JavaScript** automatically coerces values to strings. So it kind of translates it to a string anyways behind the scene.

```js
const object = {
  1.4: "Hamid",
  6: "Reza",
  3: "Ali",
};

console.log(object[1.4]); // "Hamid"
console.log(object[6]); // "Reza"
console.log(object['6']); // "Reza"
```

## Dynamic Property Access and Setting Properties Dynamically

We can access the property dynamically with `[]` square brackets:

```js
const person = {
  "first name": "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  height: 180,
};

keyName = "first name";

console.log(person[keyName]); // "Hamid"
console.log(person.keyName); // undefined
```

That wouldn't work with the `.` dot notation, because with the `.` dot notation, **JavaScript** would always search for a property with the name (`keyName` in `person`). So not with the value stored in `keyName`, but with `keyName` as a name in `person` (result will `undefined`). With `[]` square brackets, we can dynamically lookup values.

We can also setting properties dynamically:

```js
const userChoiceKey = "level";

const person = {
  "first name": "Hamid",
  [userChoiceKey]: "This value is `level`",
  age: 23,
  height: 180,
};

keyName = "first name";

console.log(person[keyName]); // "Hamid"
console.log(person[userChoiceKey]); // "This value is `level`"
```

or

```js
const addMovieButton = document.getElementById("add-movie-btn");

const addMovieHandler = () => {
  const title = document.getElementById("title").value;
  const extraName = document.getElementById("extra-name").value;
  const extraValue = document.getElementById("extra-value").value;

  const movies = [];

  if (
    title.trim() === "" ||
    extraName.trim() === "" ||
    extraValue.trim() === ""
  ) {
    return;
  }

  const newMovie = {
    info: {
      title,
      [extraName]: extraValue,
    },
    id: Math.random(),
  };
  movies.push(newMovie);
  console.log(movies);
};

addMovieButton.addEventListener("click", addMovieHandler);

/*
console.log(movies)
[{…}]
0:
id: 0.7939495269983203
info:
Level: "5"
title: "JavaScript Course"
__proto__: Object
__proto__: Object
length: 1
__proto__: Array(0)
*/
```

## Shorthand Property Syntax

If we have a property name which is exactly equal to our value name, we can actually omit the value name and the `:` colon and **JavaScript** behind the scenes will automatically set this to this here basically:

```js
const title = document.getElementById("title").value;
const extraName = document.getElementById("extra-name").value;
const extraValue = document.getElementById("extra-value").value;

// normal
const newMovie = {
  title: title,
  extraName: extraName,
  extraValue: extraValue,
};

// shorthand property
const newMovie = {
  title,
  extraName,
  extraValue,
};
```

We also have this way for function; that called **concise method**, for example:

```js
// normal
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  sayHi: function () {
    console.log("Hi There!");
  },
};

person.sayHi(); // "Hi There!"

// shorthand property - concise method
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  age: 23,
  sayHi: function () {
    console.log("Hi There!");
  },
};

person.sayHi(); // "Hi There!"
```

As you can see, we can omit the `:` colon and `function` keyword and write a function directly.

## `...` Spread Operator

Objects are **reference values** - you learned that. For example:

```js
const person = { name: "Hamid", hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"] };
const anotherPerson = person;

person.age = 23;

console.log(anotherPerson); // { name: 'Hamid', hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming' ], age: 23 }
```

As you can see, objects are reference values. We can avoid this with `...` spread operator:

```js
const person = { name: "Hamid", hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"] };
const anotherPerson = { ...person };

person.age = 23;

console.log(anotherPerson); // { name: 'Hamid', hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming' ] }
```

So it creates a new object but copies over the values we have in the keys of the old object and not only values, but also the key names.

Instead, it just copies the top level key-value pairs into a brand new object, and any nested reference values are kept. The addresses are kept:

```js
const person = { name: "Hamid", hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"] };
const anotherPerson = { ...person };

person.age = 23;
person.hobbies.push("Reading");

console.log(anotherPerson); // { name: 'Hamid', hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming', 'Reading' ] }
```

We can also avoid this with `...` spread operator (manually creating an copy array), for example:

```js
const person = { name: "Hamid", hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"] };
const anotherPerson = { ...person, hobbies: [...person.hobbies] };
person.hobbies.push("Reading");

console.log(person); // { name: 'Hamid', hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming', 'Reading' ] }
console.log(anotherPerson); // { name: 'Hamid', hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming' ] }
```

These take a little bit performance, we don't recommend you to use this way.

We can also copying object with the new way, the `Object.assign`:

```js
const person = { name: "Hamid" };
const anotherPerson = Object.assign({}, person);

person.age = 23;

console.log(person); // { name: 'Hamid', age: 23 }
console.log(anotherPerson); // { name: 'Hamid' }
```

Again, we don't recommend you to use this way, so if you want use these ways, we recommend you to use `...` spread operator.

## Object Destructuring

destructuring assignment syntax is a **JavaScript** expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. Consider:

```js
const user = {
  id: 42,
  is_verified: true,
};

const { id, is_verified } = user;

console.log(id); // 42
console.log(is_verified); // true
```

A property can be unpacked from an object and assigned to a variable with a different name than the object property:

```js
const user = {
  id: 42,
  is_verified: true,
};

const { id: userId, is_verified: validation } = user;

console.log(userId); // 42
console.log(validation); // true
```

Here, for example, `const { id: userId } = user` takes from the object `user` the property named `id` and assigns it to a local variable named `userId`.

We can also use object destructuring with nested objects:

```js
const metadata = {
  title: "Scratchpad",
  translations: [
    {
      locale: "ir",
      localization_tags: [],
      last_edit: "2020-10-14T08:43:37",
      url: "/ir/docs/Tools/Scratchpad",
      title: "JavaScript",
    },
  ],
  url: "/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad",
};

let {
  title: englishTitle, // rename
  translations: [
    {
      title: localeTitle, // rename
    },
  ],
} = metadata;

console.log(englishTitle); // "Scratchpad"
console.log(localeTitle); // "JavaScript"
```

We can use rest properties (`...` operator) for object destructuring. Rest properties collect the remaining own enumerable property keys that are not already picked off by the destructuring pattern:

```js
const numbers = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5, f: 6, g: 7 };
const { a, b, ...others } = numbers;

console.log(a, b); // 1 2
console.log(others); // { c: 3, d: 4, e: 5, f: 6, g: 7 }
```

## Checking for Property Existence

We can check for property existence with `in` keyword, for example:

```js
const person = { name: "hamid", age: 23 };

if ("name" in person) {
  console.log("Yeah"); // "Yeah"
}

if ("hobbies" in person) {
  console.log("Yeah");
} else {
  console.log("Noo"); // "Noo"
}
```

## Introducing `this`

A function's `this` keyword behaves a little differently in **JavaScript** compared to other languages. It also has some differences between **strict** mode and **non-strict** mode.

In most cases, the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. ES5 introduced the `bind()` method to set the value of a function's `this` regardless of how it's called, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which don't provide their own `this` binding (it retains the `this` value of the enclosing lexical context). (getting from MDN).

```js
const something = {
  prop: 23,
  func: function () {
    return this.prop;
  },
};

console.log(something.func()); // 23
```

In the global execution context (outside of any function), `this` refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not:

```js
// In web browsers, the `window` object is also the global object:
console.log(this === window); // true

age = 23;
console.log(window.age); // 23

this.name = "Hamid";
console.log(window.name); // "Hamid"
console.log(name); // "Hamid"
```

**Note**: The browser binds `this` for you (on event listeners) to the DOM elements that triggered the event.

In **JavaScript**, every function created with the `function` keyword (or with shorthand method) has its own `this` binding. It's bind to whatever is responsible for executing the function. But `() => { }` arrow functions don't bind `this` to anything. They don't know the `this` keyword, because `this` inside of an arrow function behaves exactly like `this` outside of that arrow function.

Different of normal `function` and arrow `function` is:

```js
// normal function
const searchButton = document.getElementById("search-btn");

const searchMovieHandler = function () {
  console.log(this); // <button id="search-btn">Search</button>
  const filterTerm = document.getElementById("filter-title").value;
  renderMovies(filterTerm);

searchButton.addEventListener("click", searchMovieHandler);
};

// arrow function
const searchButton = document.getElementById("search-btn");

const searchMovieHandler = () => {
  console.log(this); // Window {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 0, frames: Window, …}
  const filterTerm = document.getElementById("filter-title").value;
  renderMovies(filterTerm);

searchButton.addEventListener("click", searchMovieHandler);
};
```

As we mentioned, arrow `functions` don't bind `this` to anything; they don't know the `this` keyword.

**Warning**: You can't use `this` in free space of code (not includes function, if and so on).

But, arrow `functions` can shine sometimes, for example:

```js
// normal function
const members = {
  teamName: "Persian Sight",
  people: ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"],
  getTeamMember() {
    this.people.forEach(function (p) {
      console.log(p + " - " + this.teamName);
    });
  },
};

members.getTeamMember();
/*
Hamid - undefined
Hamed - undefined
Ali - undefined
*/

// arrow function
const members = {
  teamName: "Persian Sight",
  people: ["Hamid", "Hamed", "Ali"],
  getTeamMember() {
    this.people.forEach((p) => {
      console.log(p + " - " + this.teamName);
    });
  },
};

members.getTeamMember();
/*
Hamid - Persian Sight
Hamed - Persian Sight
Ali - Persian Sight
*/
```

Now it doesn't work anymore in normal function, why is that? We create this function which we pass to `forEach()`. Now when we create this function like `function (p) { .. }` with the `function` keyword, `this` is bound. As we mentioned, **that function created with the `function` keyword, bind `this` inside of them**.

> Don't worry, we will cover `this` in next modules (courses).

## `this` - Summary

`this` refers to different things, depending on where it's used and how (if used in a function) a function is called. Generally, `this` refers to the **thing** which called a function (if used inside of a function). That can be the global context, an object or some bound data / object (e.g. when the browser binds `this` to the button that triggered a click event).

> **1**- this in Global Context (i.e. outside of any function

```js
function something() { .. }

console.log(this); // logs global object (window in browser) - always (also in strict mode)!
```

> **2**- `this` in a Function (non-Arrow) - Called in the global context

```js
function something() {
  console.log(this);
}

something(); // logs global object (window in browser) in non-strict mode, undefined in strict mode
```

> **3**- `this` in an Arrow-Function - Called in the global context

```js
const something = () => {
  console.log(this);
};

something(); // logs global object (window in browser) - ALWAYS (also in strict mode)!
```

> **4**- `this` in a Method (non-Arrow) - Called on an object

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  greet: function () { // or use method shorthand: greet() { ... }
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

person.greet(); // logs "Hamid", `this` refers to the person object
```

> **5**- `this` in a Method (Arrow Function) - Called on an object

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

person.greet(); // logs nothing (or some global name on window object), `this` refers to global (window) object, even in strict mode
```

`this` can refer to unexpected things if you call it on some other object, e.g.:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Hamid",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

const anotherPerson = { name: "Hamed" }; // does NOT have a built-in greet method!

anotherPerson.sayHi = person.greet; // `greet` is NOT called here, it's just assigned to a new property / method on the `anotherPerson` object

anotherPerson.sayHi(); // logs "Hamed" because method is called on `anotherPerson` object => `this` refers to the 'thing' which called it
```

If in doubt, a `console.log(this);` can always help you find out what `this` is referring to at the moment!

## `call()` and `apply()` Methods

The `bind()` method returns a new function, when invoked, has its `this` sets to a specific value.

The following illustrates the syntax of the `bind()` method:

```js
function.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]]);
```

In this syntax, the `bind()` method **returns a copy of the function** `function` with the specific `this` value (thisArg) and arguments (arg1, arg2, …).

Unlike the `call()` and `apply()` methods, the `bind()` method doesn’t immediately execute the function. It just returns the function.

`call()` method immediately execute the function. The `call()` method is a **predefined JavaScript** method. It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter). With `call()`, an object can use a method belonging to another object.

This example calls the `fullName` method of `person`, using it on `person1`:

```js
const person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const person1 = {
  firstName: "Hamid",
  lastName: "Alavi",
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "Hamed",
  lastName: "Alavi",
};

console.log(person.fullName.call(person1)); // "Hamid Alavi"
```

The `apply()` method is similar to the `call()` method. for example:

```js
const person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const person1 = {
  firstName: "Hamid",
  lastName: "Alavi",
};

console.log(person.fullName.apply(person1)); // "Hamid Alavi"
```

The different is:

- The `call()` method takes arguments separately (ex: `obj.call(object, x, y, z)`).

The `apply()` method takes arguments as an array (ex: `obj.apply(object, [x, y, z])`.

## Getters and Setters

In **JavaScript**, a **setter** can be used to execute a function whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed. Setters are most often used in conjunction with getters to create a type of pseudo-property. It is not possible to simultaneously have a setter on a property that holds an actual value. For example:

```js
const person = {
  info: {
    set name(val) {
      if (val.trim() === "") {
        this._name = "DEFAULT";
        return;
      }
      this._name = val;
    },
    get name() {
      return this._name + " Alavi";
    },
    age: 23,
  },
  hobbies: ["programming", "Gaming"],
};

person.info.name = "";
console.log(person.info.name); // DEFAULT

person.info.name = "Hamid";
console.log(person.info.name); // Hamid Alavi

console.log(person); // { info: { name: [Getter/Setter], age: 23, _name: 'Hamid' }, hobbies: [ 'programming', 'Gaming' ] }
```

You can create read-only properties or add extra validation with fallback values with getter and setter.
