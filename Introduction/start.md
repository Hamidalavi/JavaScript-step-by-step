# JavaScript Introduction

## What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is **dynamic, weakly type** programming language which is **compiled at runtime**. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine (**host environment**).

**JavaScript** was created **to make webpages more dynamic** (e.g. change content on a page directly from inside the browser). Orginally, it was called **LiveScript** but due to the popularity of **Java**, it was renamed to **JavaScript**.

> **Warning**: **JavaScript** is totally independent from **Java** and has nothing in common with **Java**!

## How Do Webpages Work?

When someone (user) visit and interact the **Client** (browser), a **request** is sent to the server, where HTML file is hosted and send back **reponse** to the client (if user doing something like clicking a button or loading a web page). In this way, **JavaScript** makes this more **reactive**.
