# Asynchronous Code

In this course, you will learn about:

- What is **Async Code**
- Working with  Callbacks
- Promises
- `async` / `await`

## Synchronous Code Execution

**JavaScript** is single-threaded, it can only execute one task at a time, consider:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const output = document.querySelector("p");

function trackUserHandler() {}

button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);
```

**JavaScript** parses and executes our code from top to buttom. In above code, **JavaScript** selects that `<button>` and stores it in a constant. Then only once first line finished, the second line is executed and this task is performed.

When **JavaScript** reads the file at the beginning, the in the execution process, this `button.addEventListener...` line executes after these two lines (first and second) executed. Because we need the `button` to be available in order to add an event listener. So we rely on this order which is enforced by **JavaScript**.

Multi-thread is bad for **JavaScript**. If it would be multi-threaded, it could maybe execute all tasks at the same time and here this would actually be bad, because we could not rely on the `button` to be available when we need it. For example, if `button.addEventListener...` line is executed at the same time as `const button = document...` line, then the `button` might not have been selected yet and therefore adding an event listener to it would maybe fail.
