# Classes & Object-oriented Programming

In this course, you learn about:

- What is **Object-oriented Programming** (OOP)?
- Classes & Instances
- Properties, Fields & Methods
- Inheritance

## Classes and Instances

The `class` skeleton is:

```js
class Example {
    ...
}
```

Let's take a look with different of `object` and `class`:

```js
const example1 = {
  title: "DEAFAULT",
  description: "NO DESCRIPTION",
};

class Example2 {
  title = "DEAFAULT";
  description = "NO DESCRIPTION";
}
```

- In `class` we must use `=` assignment instead of `:` colon.
- In `class` we must put `;` semicolon instead of `,` comma in the end of line after such a field.
- The convention is to **start with an uppercase character** (ex: `Example2`).
- In `class` we call `field` instead of `property`.

Now, how can we instance the `class`? This is simple, with `new` keyword, for example:

```js
class MyClass {
  title = "DEAFAULT";
  description = "NO DESCRIPTION";
}

console.log(MyClass); // [class MyClass]
console.log(new MyClass()); // MyClass { title: 'DEAFAULT', description: 'NO DESCRIPTION' }
console.log(MyClass()); // TypeError: Class constructor MyClass cannot be invoked without 'new'
```

To start with, let's give you a simplistic, high-level view of what Object-oriented programming (OOP) is. We say **simplistic**, because OOP can quickly get very complicated, and giving it a full treatment now would probably confuse more than help. The basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs, and / or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.

Objects can contain related **data** and **code**, which represent information about the thing you are trying to model, and functionality or behavior that you want it to have. Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is **encapsulated**) inside an object package (which can be given a specific name to refer to, which is sometimes called a **namespace**), making it easy to structure and access; objects are also commonly used as data stores that can be easily sent across the network.
