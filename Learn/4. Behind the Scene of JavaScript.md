# How JavaScript Works, The Weird Parts & ES5 vs #ES6+

What is ES mean? ES stands for **ECMAScript**. ECMAScript and therefore **JavaScript** will evolve over the time.

**Note**: ECMA = European Computer Manufacturers Association.

## `var` vs `let` vs `const`

`var` allows us to create variable in the **function** and **global** scope.

`let` does not really use function and **global** scope, although in many cases in behaves exactly like that, but it uses a concept called **block scope** and the same is true for `const`. Let's do this with some examples.

Consider this example:

```js
var name = "Hamid";
var name = "Hamed";
var name = "Ali";
console.log(name); // "Ali"
```

We declared three variables with same name. **JavaScript** automatically executes (choose) the last declared variable (if they are in same name). Actually, the latest variable will override all previous ones.

But it's not works on `let` keyword (or `const`), you will get an error for doing same behavior. For example:

```js
let name = "Hamid";
let name = "Hamed"; // error is here
let name = "Ali";
let name = "Reza";
console.log(name); // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
```

As a mention, we said `let` keyword is **block scope**. What is it mean?

Consider:

```js
{
  var name1 = "Hamid";
  let name2 = "Hamed";
}
console.log(name1, name2); // ReferenceError: name2 is not defined -- name1 = "Hamid"
```

As you can see, `let` keyword is just available in `{ .. }` pair. It's a best thing and secure your code.

In other hand, we have **function scope**. In **JavaScript** with `let` and `const` you can define variables or constants in global scope or block scope (local scope) and use them in their own scope. But with `var`, variables are accessible entire the **function scope**. In other words, `var` only knows **global scope** and **function scope**, as we said before, but `let` and `const` knows **block scope**. For example:

```js
function hobby() {
  if (true) {
    var myHobby = "Programming";
  }
  console.log(`My favorite hobby is ${myHobby}`);
}

hobby(); // "My favorite hobby is Programming"
```

Let's try it with `let` and `const` keyword:

```js
function hobby() {
  if (true) {
    let myHobby = "Programming";
  }
  console.log(`My favorite hobby is ${myHobby}`);
}

hobby(); // ReferenceError: myHobby is not defined
```

```js
function hobby() {
  if (true) {
    const myHobby = "Programming";
  }
  console.log(`My favorite hobby is ${myHobby}`);
}

hobby(); // ReferenceError: myHobby is not defined
```

Because `let` and `const` are **block scope**. So don't use `var` anymore.

## Shadowing Variables

You learned about **local** and **global** variables scope in this [link](https://github.com/Hamidalavi/Javascript-tips) and previous section. What happens if you have this code?

```js
let userName = "Hamid";

function User(name) {
  let userName = name;
  console.log(name);
}

userName = "Hamed";
User("Hamid"); // "Hamid"
```

This **will actually show** an output that says `"Hamid"` (not `"Hamed"`). You might've expected that an error gets thrown because we use and declare `userName` more than once - and as you learned, that is not allowed (more info in 2.Basics). Let's see another example:

```js
let name = "Hamid";

function greet() {
  let name = "Ali";
  console.log(name);
}

greet(); // "Ali"
```

If we also change the `name` value, it not works anymore, because that variables (first one) is ignored. For example:

```js
let name = "Hamid";

function greet() {
  let name = "Ali";
  console.log(name);
}

name = "Reza"; // -- edit global vriable
greet(); // "Ali"
```

Here, if we use `var` keyword, we get a same result. What happens if we use `name` twice?

```js
var name = "Hamid";
var name = "Hamed";

function greet() {
  let name = "Ali";
  console.log(name);
}

console.log(name); // "Hamed"

greet(); // "Ali"
```

As you can see,we got `"Hamed"` in output. Because the latest variable will override all previous ones.
