# More About Classes & Objects - Constructor Functions & Prototypes

In this course, you learn about:

- What Happens Behind The Scenes of Classes and Objects
- Constructor Functions (Without Classes)
- Prototype & Prototypical Inheritance

## Constructor Functions vs Classes

Consider:

```js
class Person {
  name = "Hamid";
  constructor() {
    this.age = 23;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`);
  }
}

const person = new Person();
person.greet(); // Hi, I am Hamid and I am 23 years old
```

You learend how to use fields and methods and constructors and etc. before. This is a **class**.

But what is `constructor function`? It caught your eye a lot and you worked with it a lot before; see the following snippet:

```js
function Person() {
  this.name = "Hamid";
  this.age = 23;
  this.greet = function () {
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`);
  };
}

const person = new Person();
person.greet(); // Hi, I am Hamid and I am 23 years old
```

As you can see, we use `function` keyword. It looks like a function. This is a **constructor function**. If you see the previous snippet, you know how easy it is (**constructor functions**).

What happens when we delete the `new` keyword? Let's do this:

```js
function Person() {
  this.name = "Hamid";
  this.age = 23;
  this.greet = function () {
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`);
  };
}

const person = Person();
person.greet(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'greet' of undefined
```

Because this just calling (executing) the function (class), not `return` any method (field and etc.). When we use the `new` keyword in front of `className`, behind the scences, this class create an empty object named `this`, then it adds all properties to this empty object and then it return `this`. For example:

```js
function Person() {
  this = {...};
  return this;
}
```

Different of constructor functions and classes:

|Constructor Functions|Classes|
|:-:|:-:|
|Blueprint for Objects|Blueprint for Objects|
|Properties & Methods|Properties & Methods|
|Can be called with `new`|Must be called with `new`|
|All properties and methods are enumerable|Methods are non-enumerable by default|
|Not in strict mode by default|Always in strict mode|
