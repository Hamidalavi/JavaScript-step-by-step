# NodeJS Introduction

In this course, you will learn about:

- What is Exactly Node.js
- Writing Node.js Code
- Using Express.js
- Database

## about Node.js

As you learned, **JavaScript** is a hosted language. That means **JavaScript** itself can be implemented in different environments.

**Node.js** is essentially the extracted V8 engine Chrome offers, enriched by extra APIs. So its that engine you know from the browser; but basically instead of the browser APIs, it has access to other APIs and it runs outside of the browser. This is **Node.js**. We dont work with DOM and storage in this course.

You can download **Node.js** app in <https://nodejs.org/en/> website. If you are using other OS, use these commands:

- `sudo apt-get install nodejs` for Ubuntu
- `pkg install nodejs` for Android (via termux app)
- `pacman -Syu nodejs npm` for Arch Linux
- `pkg install node` for FreeBSD
  - Or compile it on your own using `ports`: `cd /usr/ports/www/node && make install`
- `emerge nodejs` for Gentoo
- `yum install nodejs14` for IBM i

Other installations are in [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) link.

## Writing Node.js Code

Once you download and install **Node.js**, you can use it everywhere (outside of browser) or you can use it in terminal or command prompt (cmd) with `node` (or `node.exe`) command. As you know, **Node.js** is very similar to **JavaScript**.

We can execute some code with `node <file-name>.js` command; let's make an `app.js` file and write some code:

```js
console.log("Hamid");

node app.js
// "Hamid"
```

If you remember, we worked with `webpack`. Most of them are compatible with **Node.js** and browser doesn't know them and they of course do not run inside of a browser (e.g. `module.exports` or `require...` and so on). Behind the scenes, `webpack` uses **Node.js** to read in our file.

We said **browser doesn't know them**, that means:

```js
document.getElementById("my-id");

node app.js
// ReferenceError: document is not defined
```

## Work with File System

As you know before, you can use **JavaScript** in Browser-side and Other-side (e.g. server-side).

> in browser-side:

- **JavaScript** was invented to create more dynamic websites by executing in the browser! That's the origin of **JavaScript**.

- **JavaScript** can manipulate the HTML code, CSS, send background Http requests and allows interaction with web page and browser APIs (e.g. get user location) and much more.

- **JavaScript** **can't** access the local filesystem (interact with the operating system etc.).

> in other-side (e.g. server-side like Node.js):

- Google’s **JavaScript** Engine (V8) extracted to run **JavaScript** anywhere (called **Node.js**).

- **Node.js** can be executed on any machine and is therefore often used to build web backends (server-side **JavaScript**).

- **Node.js** **can** access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system etc. It **can't** manipulate HTML or CSS.

We access the local filesystem or interact with the operating system with `fs`, for example:

```js
const filesystem = require("fs");

or

import filesystem from "fs"; // need module type (ES6+)
```

We can write a file with `filesystem.writeFile()`, this method takes three parameters, the **first one** is the file name or the specific path, the **second one** is for data (data includes everythings) and the **third one** is a callback function for error message:

```js
const filesystem = require("fs");

filesystem.writeFile("test.md", "# Hello Hamid", (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
      console.log("wrote to file!")
  }
});

node app.js
"wrote to file!" // test.md file created
```

We can read a file with `filesystem.readFile()` method. We use two paramters in this method, the **first one** is the file name or the specific path, the **second one** is a callback function that takes two arguments; **first** for error and **second** for file data:

```js
const filesystem = require("fs");

filesystem.readFile("test.md", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data.toString());
});

node app.js
"# Hello Hamid"
```

We convert the data to string to being readable for us. If we don't convert it, it will be `<Buffer 23 20 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 48 61 6d 69 64>` which is coming from parsing the file.

The easier way that we can change the file Unicode to UTF-8 (another parameter). Then we don't need to use `toString()` method:

```js
const filesystem = require("fs");

filesystem.readFile("test.md", "UTF-8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});

node app.js
"# Hello Hamid"
```

**Note**: You can also use `"utf8"` | `"utf-8"` | `"UTF8"` for `readFile()` method as a parameter.

## Http

First of all we need to import `http` module:

```js
const http = require("http");
```

It's a module that allows us to work with HttpRequests. If we want to create a sever (local web server), we need to use `createServer()` method:

```js
http.createServer();
```

This method requires one important argument for that, **a request listener**. This is a function which in the end triggers for every incoming request. This request listener function takes two arguments which are passed in automatically by **Node.js**; that's a **request** object and a **response** object:

```js
http.createServer((request, response) => {});
```

> response object

To write some data to the response, we need to use `write()` method:

```js
const http = require("http");

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.write("Hello there!");
});
```

We also need to pass the `end()` method for send the response. So `end()` basically tells **Node.js** "we're done adding data to the response, you can close it and send it back":

```js
const http = require("http");

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.write("Hello there!");
  response.end();
});
```

This is a very very simple web sever. With the server created, we need to do one more thing though. We need to call `listen()` on it.

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.write("Hello there!");
  response.end();
});

server.listen();
```

`listen()` is required to then actually start the server. In this case:

- `createServer()` for creating a server.
- `listen()` listens to incoming requests.

If we want to work with our web server, we need to pass a port into `listen()` method:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.write("Hello there!");
  response.end();
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Now you see the content (i.e. `Hello there!`) in `http://localhost:3000/` or `localhost:3000`.

We can also use html content in there:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.write("<h1>Hamid</h1>");
  response.end();
});

server.listen(3000);
```

It looks OK, but we don't have any headers for this page, we can add a header with `setHeader()` method:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
  response.write("<h1>Hamid</h1>");
  response.end();
});

server.listen(3000);
```

As you can see, this method takes two arguments where the first argument is the header identifier and the second argument is the value for that header. In this example, we wrote `"Content-Type"` (we worked with that before on client-side **JavaScript**).

You test this code, right? do you See the problem?

Yes, this is a plain text that is just `<h1>Hamid</h1>` (don't parse it as HTML). We can change the value to `text/html` to fix this problem:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  response.write("<h1>Hamid</h1>");
  response.end();
});

server.listen(3000);
```

**Warning**: If you don't set headers for your page, maybe some modern browsers know that (i.e. automatically convert to h1 `Hamid`), but other browsers don't support that and your web content may break or being fragmentary for this reason. If you set headers for your page, all browsers will then do that.

> request object

We talk about request a value, first of all, we need to add a basic html form:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <form method="POST" action="/">
        <input type="text" name="username">
        <button type="submit">Send!</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

Then we read this file with our knowledge (instead of writing this code manually):

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  fs.readFile("test.html", (err, data) => {
    response.write(data);
    response.end();
  });
});

server.listen(3000);
```

If we want to see behind the scenes of request object, we need to:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  console.log(request.method, request.url);
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  fs.readFile("test.html", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    response.write(data);
    response.end();
  });
});

server.listen(3000);
```

We added `console.log(request.method, request.url);` to see what happens in there. If we reload the page, we see the output that is `GET /`, and if we click on a button, we will see `POST /`; because we send a request.

Thereafter, if we type `Hamid` in input and click on the `Send` button, it will be changed to `username=Hamid`. We can send a request with a strange way:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  let body = [];
  request.on("data", (chunk) => {
    body.push(chunk);
  });
  request.on("end", () => {
    body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
    console.log(body);
  });
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  fs.readFile("test.html", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    response.write(data);
    response.end();
  });
});

server.listen(3000);
```

We can also show the real-time `username`:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  let body = [];
  request.on("data", (chunk) => {
    body.push(chunk);
  });
  request.on("end", () => {
    body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
    let userName = "Unknown User";
    if (body) {
      userName = body.split("=")[1];
    }

    fs.readFile("test.html", (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      response.write(`<h1>Hello ${userName}</h1> ${data}`);
      response.end();
    });
  });
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
});

server.listen(3000);
```

1. `request.on("data", (chunk) => { .. }` for adding data into an array.
2. `body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();` is the end, just one way of converting this array of encoded chunks into a normal string.
3. We can see the data with `console.log(body)` to see what happens behind the scenes.
4. We put the `fs.readFile` and `response.write()` and `response.end()` into the `request.do()` methods. Because they (`request.do("data", ...)` and `request.do("end", ...)`) run asynchrony.
5. ``response.write(`<h1>Hello ${userName}</h1>`);`` for showing the `username` in real-time.

## Express.js Framework

This is a papular framework for **Node.js**. With this framework, we can write code more readable and easier.

First of all, we need to install Express framework with:

```bash
npm install --save express
```

**Note**: Make sure you did the `npm init` configuration.

Then we must add the `express` into our project:

```js
const express = require("express");
```

Thereafter we need to add the main app of Express framework:

```js
const app = express();
```

This gives us such a app object which in the end is an object with a lot of features and functions provided by Express.

The amazing feature is that the Express and `app` object therefore sets up the server for us behind the scenes. It means that we only need to write:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.listen(3000);
```

We can eaily send a request or a response with this module, for that we need to write `app.use()`:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use((request, response) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  response.send("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

It's exactly like:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  response.write("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
  response.end();
});

server.listen(3000);
```

In the `app.use((..) => { .. });` function, we also have third optional `next` parameter.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  next();
});

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.send("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

This is a function we can execute like `next()`; and all `next()` does is, it tells Express.js that we're not done yet; that instead it should move on to the next middleware in line and call that with the request, with the response, and with `next()` which we don't call in the second middleware though, because we're done with the response and the request here. We send back a response so we don't want to handle the request in any other middleware thereafter, because we already send the response. What elso would we do with the request.

**Note**: Middleware means `app.use((..) => { .. };)`.

## Extracting Data

For extracting data, we need to write `npm install --save body-parser` command to install the `body-parser` package in our project path. Then we add it into our project:

```js
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
```

Then we make a new middleware and use the `bodyParser`:

```js
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

It parses and exracts the incoming body, the request body ands the parsed body back into that body field on the requst object.

**Note1**: `urlencoded` returns middleware that only parses urlencoded bodies and only looks at requests where the `Content-Type` header matches the type option. We can use `JSON` format (i.e. `bodyParser.json()`).

**Note2**: The `extended` option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data with the querystring library (when `false`) or the qs library (when `true`).

We can show (render) a real-time username with:

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  next();
});

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  const userName = request.body.username || "KNOWN USERNAME";
  response.send(
    `<h1>Hi ${userName}</h1> <form method="POST" action="/"><input type="text" name="username"><button type="submit">Send!</button></form>`
  );
});

app.listen(3000);
```

- ``response.send(`<h1>Hello ${userName}</h1>`);`` for showing the `username` in real-time. For that, we need to write `request.body.username`. It means the username of the body array is `username`.

## Rendering Server-side HTML with Templates and EJS

We can render server-side HTML with `ejs` package. The **first** step is to install this package with `npm install --save ejs` command:

```bash
npm install --save ejs
```

The **second** step is for creating a new file to store our HTML files we want to send back. Though we'll not actually create a HTML file in there, but instead a **template** which contains HTML content; but where we can also inject dynamic content. So we can have a mixure of HTML static content and dynamic content. This will be all then merged together into HTML file on the server-side and sent back to the client.

So on the client we will receive an HTML file but it allows us to enrich this HTML file with dynamic content. For that, we need the `ejs` package, a library that allows us to define such a template which then parses the template file and finds a special syntax in there which we can use to output dynamic content and that makes working with such a template easier.

We need to tell Express.js, which supports such templating engine as they are called. We want to use this templating engine; and we do tell Express.js us if we want to do that, by calling the `set()` method on the `app` object which allows us to set up some global options and there we want to set the `view engine` option (with a whitespace between the two words) to `ejs` ...:

```js
const app = express();
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
```

which tells Express that the engine for parsing our views (our template) should be `ejs` (the package we just installed) and then we also tell Express.js where it finds our views; and for that, we add a `views` setting and point at the folder that holds our view files. Our case, that's `views` but if named that folder differently, you would have to change it here.

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");
...
```

Now with that, we can add such a template in the `views` folder and we'll add an `index.ejs` file. This means that `ejs`, this package we just installed will be able to detect this file and parse it.

In this file, we generally just write HTML code as we're used to it but we can add a special syntax which the `ejs` package understands to inject dynamic content. Let's make a HTML content in `index.ejs` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Node Demo</title>
</head>

<body>
    <form action="/" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="username">
        <button type="submit">Send!</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

We just want to use one of the most basic features with an `<%= %>` and now between that, we can refer to any variable name which we plan on providing to this view and we'll come back to how we provide that in a second.

So here (in `index.ejs` file) we'll point at `user`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Node Demo</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello <%= user %></h1>
    <form action="/" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="username">
        <button type="submit">Send!</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

We'll take `user` here and now we have this special syntax in here. This is of course not regular HTML; but instead, this is simply a syntax understood by the `ejs` package when it later parses this file.

Now to tell `ejc` to parse this file, we need to make sure that we don't set back a response like `response.send("<h1>Hello xxx</h1>)`. But instead here, we want to render a view as a response; and for that, the `response` object has a `render()` method, also added by Express.js (i.e. this does not exist in pure **Node.js**).

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  next();
});

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  const userName = request.body.username || "KNOWN USERNAME";
  response.render();
});

app.listen(3000);
```

The `render()` method takes a couple of arguments and the **first** argument is the name of the **view** we want to render. In our case, that's `index`, because we have the `index.ejs` file in the views folder. We don't need to specify the path, because we set the `views` folder to be the folder that holds our views up there. So now here, `index` also no extensions required, because we told Express that we use `ejs` and that will automatically look for a `.ejs` extension.

We can continue with the **second** argument and that would be an object full of properties or full of data we want to provide to this template; and here we should provide a `user` property, because that will be the data `ejs` then can use when it parses this template.

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  next();
});

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  const userName = request.body.username || "KNOWN USERNAME";
  response.render("index", { user: userName });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

We should render this file (i.e. `index.ejs`) and have our dynamic content in there.

And that's it. All things work correctly.

**Important**: If you inspect this in the browser, you get normal HTML code which is rendered here. Also in the response (**Network** tab> Response in developer tools), if you have a look that in the **Response** tab, you'll see you get a normal HTML code. We have no dynamic part here, because this dynamic segment is filled on the server. On the server we generate a HTML document which is then appended to the outgoing response. **That's what the `view engine` does here**.

## Simple EJS for JSON Data

```js
// without HTML file
let ejs = require('ejs');
let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});

// without HTML file
let ejs = require('ejs');
let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
let html = ejs.render('index', {people: people});
```

More information: <https://ejs.co/>

To implement this new approuch, we could delete the `views` folder but we can also just ignore it:

```js
// commented
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

// app.set("view engine", "ejs");
// app.set("views", "views");

// app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// app.use((request, response, next) => {
//   response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
//   next();
// });

// app.use((request, response, next) => {
//   const userName = request.body.username || "KNOWN USERNAME";
//   response.render("index", { user: userName });
// });

app.listen(3000);


// cleaned
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();
app.listen(3000);
```

We won't send back any HTML rendered templates anymore, instead we want to exchange JSON data. Now we'll try to parse incoming JSON data here:

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.listen(3000);
```

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) - Security

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos.

The Origin is actually `[scheme]://[hostname]:[port]`, for example: <https://persiansight.com:8080>.

> How CORS works

![cors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Flowchart_showing_Simple_and_Preflight_XHR.svg/1155px-Flowchart_showing_Simple_and_Preflight_XHR.svg.png).

The CORS standard describes new HTTP headers which provide browsers with a way to request remote URLs only when they have permission. Although some validation and authorization can be performed by the server, it is generally the browser's responsibility to support these headers and honor the restrictions they impose.

For Ajax and HTTP request methods that can modify data (usually HTTP methods other than **GET**, or for **POST** usage with certain MIME types), the specification mandates that browsers **preflight** the request, soliciting supported methods from the server with an HTTP **OPTIONS** request method, and then, upon **approval** from the server, sending the actual request with the actual HTTP request method. Servers can also notify clients whether **credentials** (including Cookies and HTTP Authentication data) should be sent with requests.

For example, suppose a user visits <http://www.example.com> and the page attempts a cross-origin request to fetch the user's data from <http://service.example.com>. A CORS-compatible browser will attempt to make a cross-origin request to service.example.com as follows.

1. The browser sends the GET request with an extra `Origin` HTTP header to service.example.com containing the domain that served the parent page: `Origin: http://www.example.com`.

2. The server at service.example.com may respond with:

   - The requested data along with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (ACAO) header in its response indicating the requests from the origin are allowed. For example in this case it should be: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com`.
   - The requested data along with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (ACAO) header with a wildcard indicating that the requests from all domains are allowed: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
   - An error page if the server does not allow a cross-origin request.

This a non-**JavaScript** CORS.

List of CORS headers:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:` <http://foo.example>
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:` *
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: `POST`, `GET`, `OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: `X-PINGOTHER`, `Content-Type`
- `Access-Control-Max-Age`: 86400

List of CORS headers in express:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST", "POST", "OPTIONS");
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type");
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "86400");
  next();
});
```

## Security

- Security Details In Your Code
  - Your **JavaScript** code can be read by **anyone**
  - Security-relevant details can be read
  - Attackers may be able to abuse exposed data
  - Example: Database access credentials exposed in code
- Cross-Site Scripting Attacks (XSS)
  - Attack pattern where malicious **JavaScript** code gets injected + executed
  - Injected code can do **anything** your code could do as well
  - Very dangerous: Full behind-the-scenes control for attacker
  - Example: Unchecked user-generated content
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Attack pattern that depends on injected content (e.g. image)
  - Requests to malicious servers are made with user’s cookies
  - Actions can be executed without the user knowing
  - Example: Malicious image URL, XSS
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
  - Not an attack pattern but a security concept
  - Requests are only allowed from same origin (domain)
  - Controlled via server-side response headers and browser
  - Example: **JavaScript** Modules

> XSS example:

Don't use the `innerHTML` instead of `textContent`, because if you use the `GET` method in your code, in your URL, attackers then can use `<script></script>` tag between the URL and then execute the code. So don't use `innderHTML` for more security.

You can use `sanitize-html` package for more security.

> CSRF example: It can be related to XSS. But it doesn't have to be. The idea behind cross-side request forgery is that people trick you into clicking on a link that leads to a prepared page where they abuse your local cookies to then send a request to the page you would normally talk to as well, let's say your online banking backend, but since you are coming from a prepared page, you then do something there automatically without you recognizing that you don't want to do. For example, send money to someone you don't want to send. Maybe that even as possible to happen behind the scenes without you noticing.

For example, if you go to the fake site, then your session id, password, and other information will sent to the truthy backend without you noticing.
